## 30-MINUTE RECON PROTOCOL

### Minutes 0-5: Read Program Page

```
Note:
- ALL in-scope assets (every domain listed)
- Out-of-scope list (read carefully — common trap)
- Safe harbor statement
- Impact types accepted (some exclude "low")
- Average bounty amount (signals program generosity)
```

### Minutes 5-15: Asset Discovery

Run the standard pipeline above. Focus on live.txt output.

### Minutes 15-25: Surface Map

Run gf patterns and the interesting-params grep above.

### Minutes 25-30: Manual Exploration

Open Burp Suite. Browse the app with proxy on:
1. Register an account
2. Perform main user actions (create/read/update/delete resources)
3. Note all API calls in Burp history
4. Look for endpoints not in your URL list

### After 30 min: Prioritize

```
Priority 1: API endpoints with ID parameters → IDOR candidates
Priority 2: File upload features → XSS/RCE candidates
Priority 3: OAuth/SSO flows → auth bypass candidates
Priority 4: Search/filter with user input → SQLi/SSRF/SSTI candidates
Priority 5: Admin/debug endpoints → auth bypass candidates
```
