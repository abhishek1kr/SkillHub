# Semgrep Custom Rule Writing

## When to Use
- During a white-box penetration test or source code review when looking for bespoke vulnerabilities that generic SAST tools fail to detect.
- To codify and hunt for organization-specific anti-patterns (e.g., calling an internal API without passing the authentication context).


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding Semgrep Patterns

```yaml
# Concept: Semgrep syntax rules:
  - id: simple-eval-detection
    pattern: eval(...)
    message: "Avoid using eval() as it can lead to code injection."
    languages: [javascript, python]
    severity: ERROR
```

### Phase 2: Utilizing Metavariables

```yaml
# rules:
  - id: python-exec-with-variable
    pattern: exec($X)
    message: "Using exec() on variable $X is dangerous."
    languages: [python]
    severity: WARNING
```

### Phase 3: Pattern-Inside and Pattern-Not (Contextual Matching)

```yaml
# rules:
  - id: missing-auth-check-flask
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          @app.route(...)
          def $FUNC(...):
            ...
      - pattern: return $RENDER(...)
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          @login_required
          def $FUNC(...):
            ...
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          if current_user.is_authenticated:
            ...
    message: "Flask route missing @login_required or explicit authentication check."
    languages: [python]
    severity: ERROR
```

### Phase 4: Testing Rules via Semgrep CLI

```bash
# # semgrep --config custom-rules.yml src/
```

#### Decision Point 🔀

## 💰 Industry Bounty Payout Statistics (2024-2025)

| Company/Platform | Total Paid | Highest Single | Year |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|------|
| **Google VRP** | $17.1M | $250,000 (CVE-2025-4609 Chrome sandbox escape) | 2025 |
| **Microsoft** | $16.6M | (Not disclosed) | 2024 |
| **Google VRP** | $11.8M | $100,115 (Chrome MiraclePtr Bypass) | 2024 |
| **HackerOne (all programs)** | $81M | $100,050 (crypto firm) | 2025 |
| **Meta/Facebook** | $2.3M | up to $300K (mobile code execution) | 2024 |
| **Crypto.com (HackerOne)** | $2M program | $2M max | 2024 |
| **1Password (Bugcrowd)** | $1M max | $1M (highest Bugcrowd ever) | 2024 |
| **Samsung** | $1M max | $1M (critical mobile flaws) | 2025 |

**Key Takeaway**: Google alone paid $17.1M in 2025 — a 40% increase YoY. Microsoft paid $16.6M.
The industry is paying more, not less. Average critical bounty on HackerOne: $3,700 (2023).
