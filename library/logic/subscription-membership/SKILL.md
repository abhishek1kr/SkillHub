### Priority Attack Surface

```
1. TRIAL ABUSE ← #1 SUBSCRIPTION BUG
   POST /api/subscriptions/trial           → race (unlimited trials)
   POST /api/subscriptions/trial/start    → repeat with same card
   POST /api/subscriptions/trial/convert  → skip payment
   Test: create trial → cancel → create trial → repeat

2. DOWNGRADE / FEATURE PERSISTENCE
   PUT  /api/subscriptions/{id}/plan       → downgrade but keep features
   GET  /api/content/premium               → access after downgrade
   Test: subscribe → download → cancel → check access still works

3. GIFT CODE / PROMO ABUSE
   POST /api/gifts/redeem                  → redeem same code multiple times
   POST /api/promos/apply                  → apply unlimited promos
   GET  /api/promos/{code}                 → enumerate valid promo codes
   Test: try to stack gift subscriptions

4. CANCELLATION BYPASS
   POST /api/subscriptions/{id}/cancel     → cancel but service continues
   POST /api/subscriptions/{id}/pause      → pause but content still accessible
   Test: check feature flags and content access after cancellation

5. BILLING MANIPULATION
   POST /api/billing/invoice               → modify invoice amount
   PUT  /api/billing/card                  → use stolen/expired card
   POST /api/billing/upgrade               → proration miscalculation
   Test: intercept billing flow, modify amounts
```

3. [Medium] Gift Stack → 100 Gift Codes → 8+ Years Free → Share Account
4. [Medium] Cancel → Service Active → Continue Accessing → Never Pay
```
