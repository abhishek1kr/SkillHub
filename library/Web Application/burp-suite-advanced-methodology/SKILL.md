# Burp Suite Advanced Methodology

## When to Use
- When performing manual web application penetration testing
- When proxying and modifying HTTP traffic for vulnerability testing
- When running automated scans with Burp Scanner
- When testing authentication, authorization, and business logic flaws
- When fuzzing parameters with Intruder or Turbo Intruder


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Scope Configuration

```
# Burp Suite Professional Setup:
1. Launch Burp Suite Professional
2. Create New Project → "Disk Project" (saves progress)
3. Configure Project Options:
   - Target → Scope → Add target URLs
   - Include in scope: *.target.com
   - Exclusions: *.google.com, *.gstatic.com, logout URLs

# Proxy Setup:
1. Proxy → Options → Listeners: 127.0.0.1:8080
2. Configure browser to use localhost:8080
3. Install Burp CA certificate:
   - Navigate to http://burpsuite
   - Download CA certificate
   - Install in browser's certificate store

# Recommended Extensions:
- Autorize (IDOR/AuthZ testing)
- Logger++ (enhanced logging)
- Turbo Intruder (high-speed fuzzing)
- Hackvertor (encoding/decoding)
- Active Scan++ (enhanced scanning)
- Param Miner (hidden parameter discovery)
- JS Miner (JavaScript analysis)
- JSON Web Token Attacker
```

### Phase 2: Passive Reconnaissance (Spidering)

```
# Let Burp build the sitemap:
1. Browse the entire application through Burp proxy
2. Log in with all user roles available
3. Click every link, fill every form
4. Check Site Map → shows discovered endpoints

# Target → Site map analysis:
- Right-click target → "Spider this host"
- Review discovered endpoints
- Identify: API endpoints, forms, file uploads, WebSocket connections
- Note: Hidden parameters, commented-out code, JavaScript endpoints

# Engagement tools:
- Target → Engagement tools → "Find comments"
- Target → Engagement tools → "Find scripts"
- Target → Engagement tools → "Analyze target"
```

### Phase 3: Active Testing with Repeater

```
# Repeater — manual request manipulation:
# Send interesting requests from Proxy → Right-click → "Send to Repeater"

# Common tests in Repeater:
# 1. Authentication bypass
#    Remove/modify Authorization header
#    Change user ID in request body/URL

# 2. IDOR testing
#    Modify object IDs: /api/users/123 → /api/users/124
#    Change GUIDs, encoded values

# 3. SQL Injection
#    Add ' " ; -- to parameters
#    Test: param=1' OR '1'='1

# 4. Command Injection
#    Add: ; ls, | whoami, `id`

# 5. SSRF
#    Change URL parameters to internal addresses
#    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

# 6. Header manipulation
#    Add: X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
#    Add: X-Original-URL: /admin
#    Add: X-Rewrite-URL: /admin

# Tips:
# - Use Comparer to diff responses
# - Right-click → "Change request method" (GET↔POST)
# - Use "Follow redirect" to trace redirect chains
```

### Phase 4: Automated Testing with Intruder

```
# Intruder — automated parameter fuzzing:

# Positions tab: Mark injection points with § markers
# Attack types:
# - Sniper: One payload at a time, rotates through positions
# - Battering ram: Same payload in all positions
# - Pitchfork: Different payload list per position (parallel)
# - Cluster bomb: All combinations (cartesian product)

# Common Intruder attacks:

# 1. Directory bruteforce
#    Target: GET /§FUZZ§ HTTP/1.1
#    Payload: Wordlist (raft-medium-directories.txt)
#    Filter: Status code != 404

# 2. Credential stuffing
#    Target: POST /login
#    Type: Pitchfork
#    Position 1: §username§ → usernames list
#    Position 2: §password§ → passwords list

# 3. Parameter fuzzing
#    Target: GET /api/users?§param§=§value§
#    Type: Cluster bomb

# 4. IDOR enumeration
#    Target: GET /api/users/§1§
#    Payload: Numbers 1-10000
#    Grep extraction: Extract response fields

# Results analysis:
# Sort by: Length (different length = different response = interesting)
# Sort by: Status code
# Grep match: "admin", "password", "error"
```

### Phase 5: Turbo Intruder (High-Speed Fuzzing)

```python
# Extensions → Turbo Intruder → Send to Turbo Intruder

# Basic Turbo Intruder script:
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                          concurrentConnections=50,
                          requestsPerConnection=100,
                          pipeline=True)
    
    for word in open('/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt'):
        engine.queue(target.req, word.rstrip())

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    if req.status != 404:
        table.add(req)

# Race condition testing script:
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                          concurrentConnections=30,
                          requestsPerConnection=100,
                          pipeline=False)
    
    # Send 30 identical requests simultaneously
    for i in range(30):
        engine.queue(target.req, gate='race')
    
    engine.openGate('race')  # Release all at once

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

### Phase 6: Scanner Configuration

```
# Automated scanning:
# 1. Right-click target → "Actively scan this host"
# 2. Or select specific requests → "Do active scan"

# Scanner configuration (Dashboard → Scan):
# - Crawl settings: Max depth, form submission, login handling
# - Audit settings: Which vulnerability types to test
# - Resource pool: Control scan speed
# - Schedule: Time-based scanning

# Key scan types:
# - Crawl only: Discover endpoints without testing
# - Audit only: Test known endpoints for vulnerabilities
# - Crawl and audit: Full scan

# Results processing:
# - Dashboard → Issue activity: All findings
# - Sort by severity
# - Manually verify each finding (false positive check)
# - Generate report: Burp → Report wizard
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection
- **WAF rules**: Detect common Burp User-Agent strings and payloads
- **Rate limiting**: Detect rapid automated requests from Intruder/Scanner
- **Anomaly detection**: Alert on unusual parameter patterns (fuzzing signatures)
- **TLS inspection**: Detect MITM proxy certificates

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Proxy | Intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS traffic |
| Repeater | Manual request modification and resending |
| Intruder | Automated Parameter fuzzing and brute forcing |
| Scanner | Automated vulnerability detection |
| Collaborator | Out-of-band interaction detection server |
| Turbo Intruder | High-performance HTTP fuzzer extension |
| Autorize | Authorization testing extension |

## Output Format
```

## 🛡️ Remediation & Mitigation Strategy
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and strictly type-check all inputs.
- **Least Privilege:** Constrain component execution bounds.
