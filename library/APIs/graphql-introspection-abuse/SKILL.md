# GraphQL Introspection Abuse

## When to Use
- During the reconnaissance phase of evaluating web applications that utilize GraphQL.
- To rapidly map the API surface area without relying on brute-force directory or endpoint enumeration.
- To visualize the API schema and identify potentially vulnerable data relationships and administrative mutations.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying GraphQL Endpoints

Common endpoints include `/graphql`, `/api/graphql`, `/v1/graphql`, `/v2/graphql`, and sometimes `/gql`.

### Phase 2: Sending the Introspection Query

The standard GraphQL Introspection query requests the `__schema` field.

```json
// Concept: Request schema metadata {
  "query": "query IntrospectionQuery { __schema { queryType { name } mutationType { name } types { ...FullType } } } fragment FullType on __Type { kind name fields(includeDeprecated: true) { name args { ...InputValue } type { ...TypeRef } } } fragment InputValue on __InputValue { name type { ...TypeRef } defaultValue } fragment TypeRef on __Type { kind name ofType { kind name ofType { kind name } } }"
}
```

Send this POST request to the endpoint:
```bash
# curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"\n    query IntrospectionQuery {\n      __schema {\n        queryType { name }\n        mutationType { name }\n        subscriptionType { name }\n        types {\n          ...FullType\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    fragment FullType on __Type {\n      kind\n      name\n      description\n      fields(includeDeprecated: true) {\n        name\n        args {\n          ...InputValue\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    fragment InputValue on __InputValue {\n      name\n    }\n  "}' http://target.local/graphql
```

### Phase 3: Analyzing the Schema

If introspection is enabled, the server will return a massive JSON response containing the entire schema structure.
Use tools to visualize and parse this data:
- **GraphQL Voyager**: Paste the JSON response into GraphQL Voyager to graphically map the database relationships.
- **InQL (Burp Extension)**: Automatically detects introspection queries and generates a mock structure of all queries and mutations in your Repeater tab.

### Phase 4: Bypassing Disabled Introspection

If the server responds with a syntax error or "GraphQL introspection is not allowed", check for partial introspection or use dictionary attacks.
- **Field Suggestion (Clairvoyance)**: If you misspell a field, GraphQL might say `Did you mean "email"?`. Tools like `Clairvoyance` or `GraphW00f` can brute force and reconstruct the schema based on these error messages.
