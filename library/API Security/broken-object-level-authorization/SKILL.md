# Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR)

## When to Use
- When engaging REST APIs executing actions utilizing user IDs, invoice numbers, or UUIDs in the URI path (e.g., `/api/users/12` or `/api/invoice/ABC-123`).
- When actions refer to object primary keys inside POST/PUT bodies or query parameters.
- It is the **#1 vulnerability** in APIs according to the OWASP Top 10 API Security Project. Always test this relentlessly.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying Resource Identifiers

```http
# Concept: We must find where the API relies on an identifier to fetch, update, or delete data.

# Look closely at endpoints generating 200 OK status codes:
GET /api/v1/receipts/904                   (Path variable)
POST /api/v1/messages?conversation_id=643  (Query parameter)
{"user_id": 99, "action": "delete"}        (JSON body)

# The Threat: If I am User 99, can I read User 100's data simply by typing '100'?
```

### Phase 2: Systematic Execution (Two-Account Testing)

```text
# Concept: NEVER verify BOLA by testing arbitrary IDs blindly! You might delete or modify 
# actual production users. ALWAYS test between two accounts YOU control: "Attacker" and "Victim".

# 1. Setup Phase
#   Create Account A (Attacker): id = 100
#   Create Account B (Victim): id = 200
#   Post a private picture using Account B. Note the picture ID (e.g., pic_id=555).

# 2. Attack Execution
#   Log into Account A (Attacker).
#   Intercept the request fetching Account A's pictures:
    GET /api/photos/100 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer <Attacker_Session>

# 3. Manipulation
#   Change the path ID to the Victim's ID (or the Victim's picture ID):
    GET /api/photos/200 HTTP/1.1
    # or
    DELETE /api/photo/555 HTTP/1.1

# 4. Result Validation
#   If the server responds HTTP 200 OK and returns Victim B's sensitive data, the BOLA flaw is absolutely confirmed.
```

### Phase 3: Bypassing Weak BOLA Defenses

```text
# Concept: Developers try to implement protections, but often implement logical routing flaws instead.

# 1. Parameter Pollution (HPP)
# Feed an array or duplicate IDs to confuse the backend filter.
GET /api/profile?user_id=100&user_id=200
GET /api/profile?user_id[]=100&user_id[]=200

# 2. Add an ID into the Body
# If the path `GET /api/profile/100` prevents BOLA, what if you add the ID parameter to the JSON body instead?
GET /api/profile/100
{"user_id": 200}
# Sometimes the backend parser overwrites the validated path variable with the unvalidated JSON body variable.

# 3. Method Substitution (REST abuse)
# `PUT /api/resource/200` might hit a BOLA check. Does `POST /api/resource/200`? Does `PATCH`? 

# 4. JSON Content-Type Smuggling
# Change `Content-Type: application/json` to `Content-Type: application/xml` or `multipart/form-data`.
# A different XML parsing library on the backend might completely skip the BOLA authorization functions.
```

### Phase 4: Automation utilizing 'Autorize'

```text
# Concept: Doing this manually for 500 endpoints is impossible. Use the Burp Suite extension "Autorize".

# 1. Obtain cookies/headers for Account B (Victim / Low Privileged).
# 2. Paste headers into Autorize extension panel.
# 3. Browse the application using Account A (Attacker / High Privileged).
# 4. Autorize will capture every request Account A makes, strip Account A's cookies, inject Account B's cookies, and replay the request.
# 5. Review the Autorize dashboard: If a request meant for Account A succeeds while using Account B's session, you found an automated BOLA/IDOR flaw!
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Action-Based Authorization**: A purely valid session token string is not sufficient. The code must query the database checking the relationship: `SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = :requested_id AND owner_id = :session_user_id`. Every single data fetch must enforce this twin validation.
- **UUIDs are NOT a Defense**: Switching sequential IDs (1, 2, 3) to UUIDs (`3f84-ca9...`) prevents basic forced enumeration (guessing IDs rapidly). However, UUID implementation is inherently *Security by Obscurity*. If an attacker discovers the UUID (e.g., leaked in a URL shared on a forum), BOLA still permits them to destroy or read the data. UUIDs do not eliminate the BOLA vulnerability entirely.
- **Centralized Enforcement Policy**: Avoid writing authorization logic into every single controller function endpoint. Utilize middleware, API gateways, or framework-level policy enforcers (e.g., Pundit in Ruby, Policies in Laravel) that process rules dynamically per data model request.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| BOLA / IDOR | Broken Object Level Authorization / Insecure Direct Object Reference; exploiting authorization checks that fail to verify if the requesting user formally owns the underlying object ID requested |
| Sequential IDs | IDs generating sequentially (`id=12`, `id=13`). Highly vulnerable as an attacker merely has to iterate a number to traverse the entire database |
| UUID / GUID | Universally Unique Identifiers; 128-bit strings used to make endpoints un-guessable, but technically failing to solve underlying authorization flaws |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: Widespread BOLA resulting in PII Leakage
===========================================================
Vulnerability: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
Severity: Critical (CVSS 8.5)
Target: GET /api/v2/customer/documents/{doc_id}

Description:
The main highly-sensitive customer documentation endpoint operates primarily using sequential Database Identifiers (e.g., `/api.../documents/1045`). 

Testing across two distinctly separate authenticated accounts revealed that the endpoint heavily trusts the `doc_id` referenced in the URL path but fails to adequately confirm if the documented belongs to the `user_id` authenticated inside the Bearer token. 

Reproduction Steps:
1. Log into Attacker Account `A`.
2. Determine Account `A` possesses document ID `990`.
3. Intercept fetching your secure document: `GET /api/v2/customer/documents/990`.
4. Modify the `doc_id` inside the Burp Repeater parameter sequentially: `GET /api/v2/customer/documents/991`.
5. The API responds with an `HTTP 200 OK` exposing the PDF tax documents of a completely unrelated user possessing document 991.

Impact:
Critical failure of confidentiality. Utilizing an automated script, an attacker can iterate numbers 1 through 1,000,000, immediately scraping the highly-confidential tax records belonging to millions of platform users in under an hour.
