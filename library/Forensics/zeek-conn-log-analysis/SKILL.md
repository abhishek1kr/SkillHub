# Zeek conn.log Analysis

## When to Use
- During network forensics investigations or active threat hunting to identify compromised hosts communicating with Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
- To detect unusual network baseline deviations without relying entirely on deep packet inspection or payload signatures.


## Prerequisites
- Forensic image or live access to the affected system(s)
- Forensic workstation with analysis tools (Autopsy, Volatility, Timeline Explorer)
- Chain of custody documentation initiated for evidence handling
- Write-blocker for disk forensics or memory acquisition tool (e.g., DumpIt, WinPmem)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding conn.log Structure

```bash
# head conn.log | zeek-cut -c ts uid id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p proto service duration orig_bytes resp_bytes conn_state
```

### Phase 2: Hunting for C2 Beaconing (Frequency Analysis)

```bash
# cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h id.resp_p duration | \
awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20
```

### Phase 3: Identifying Long-Connections (Data Exfil / Interactive Shells)

```bash
# cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h id.resp_p duration orig_bytes resp_bytes | \
awk '$4 > 3600 {print $0}' | sort -nrk 4
```

### Phase 4: Detecting Odd Port-Service Mismatches

```bash
# cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.resp_p service | grep -E '^443\s+http$' | less

# cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.resp_p service | grep -E '^80\s+ssl$' | less
```
