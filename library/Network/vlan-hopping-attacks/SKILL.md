# VLAN Hopping Attacks

## When to Use
- When conducting Internal Network Penetration Testing to comprehensively validate precisely if explicitly implemented VLAN segmentation restricts intrinsically network traffic To access sensitive segmented specifically networks (e.g., Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding VLAN Hopping (The Concepts)

```text
# Concept: Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) isolate network traffic Attack ```

### Phase 2: Switch Spoofing (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)

```bash
# Concept: Cisco 1. Start specifically Yersinia GUI yersinia -G

# 2. Select ```

### Phase 3: Double Tagging (The 802.1Q Exploit)

```text
# Concept: If 1. Packet ```

### Phase 4: Validating the Hop

```bash
# Concept: Validate ```

## Prerequisites
- Network access to the target subnet (VPN, pivot, or direct connection)
- Nmap and relevant network scanning tools installed
- Understanding of TCP/IP, common protocols, and network segmentation
- Root/admin access on the attack machine for raw socket operations

Red Team Execution Protocol: VLAN Security Evasion
==================================================
Target Infrastructure: `Access Switch 04`
Vulnerability: Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) Enabled
Severity: High (CVSS 7.2)

Description:
During Action :
```bash
yersinia dtp -attack 1 -interface eth1

## 🛡️ Remediation & Mitigation Strategy
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and strictly type-check all inputs.
- **Least Privilege:** Constrain component execution bounds.
