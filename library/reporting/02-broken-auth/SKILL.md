## 2. BROKEN AUTH / ACCESS CONTROL  🔐
> #2 most paid class. The sibling function rule: if 9 endpoints have auth, the 10th that doesn't is your bug.
> **Needs auth loaded** — you're testing which sibling routes a logged-in
> user can reach that shouldn't be reachable. Compare authed responses
> against the same paths hit anonymously.

### The Sibling Rule
```
/api/admin/users  → has auth middleware
/api/admin/export → often MISSING it
/api/admin/delete → often MISSING it
/api/admin/reset  → often MISSING it
```

### Patterns
```javascript
// Missing middleware on sibling
router.get('/admin/users', authenticate, authorize('admin'), getUsers);
router.get('/admin/export', getExport);  // No middleware!

// Client-side role check only
if (user.role === 'admin') showAdminButton();
// Backend: app.post('/api/admin/delete', deleteUser); // no server check!
```

### Real Paid Examples
- **HackerOne TrustHub**: `POST /graphql` with `TrustHubQuery` — no auth, regular user reads all vendors (CVSS 8.7 High)
- **Vienna Chatbot**: WebSocket `get_history` accepts arbitrary UUID — no ownership check (P2)
