# AI Jailbreaking & System Prompt Bypasses

## When to Use
- When conducting security assessments of Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into chatbots, virtual assistants, or backend AI data processing pipelines.
- To demonstrate how instruction-tuned models can be forced into producing harmful, unethical, or restricted outputs by carefully crafting adversarial prompts.


## Prerequisites
- Access to target AI/ML system or local model deployment for testing
- Python 3.9+ with relevant ML libraries (transformers, torch, openai)
- Understanding of LLM architecture and prompt processing pipelines
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for AI red team testing

## Workflow
