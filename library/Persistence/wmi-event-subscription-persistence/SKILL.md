# WMI Event Subscription Persistence — CONSOLIDATED

> **⚠️ This skill has been consolidated.** The canonical, comprehensive version is:
> **`red-teaming/persistence/wmi-event-subscriptions`**
>
> That skill includes:
> - 4 trigger types (startup, user logon, process launch, time-based)
> - 2 consumer types (CommandLineEventConsumer, ActiveScriptEventConsumer)
> - Full OPSEC guidance and cleanup procedures
> - Comprehensive Blue Team detection via Sysmon Event IDs 19/20/21
> - Decision flowchart for choosing the right approach

## When to Use
Use `wmi-event-subscriptions` instead of this skill. This entry exists for backward compatibility.

## Prerequisites
- See the `wmi-event-subscriptions` skill for full prerequisites

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Redirect to Canonical Skill
Refer to `red-teaming/persistence/wmi-event-subscriptions` for the complete workflow.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Consolidated Skill | This was merged with two other WMI skills into a single comprehensive `wmi-event-subscriptions` skill |

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
```bash
# Standard payload injection format
curl -X POST https://target/api -d 'exploit=true'
```

## 🔵 Blue Team
- Deploy robust WAF rules to detect anomalies.
- Monitor logs for unusual access patterns.

## 🛡️ Remediation & Mitigation Strategy
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and strictly type-check all inputs.
- **Least Privilege:** Constrain component execution bounds.
