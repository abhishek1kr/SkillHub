# Windows Prefetch Analysis

## When to Use
- When investigating a compromised Windows system to answer the question: "Did the attacker actually run this tool/malware?"
- To build a timeline of threat actor activities by examining execution timestamps and accessed files.
- When an attacker has deleted their malware, but the prefetch file remains as evidence.


## Prerequisites
- Forensic image or live access to the affected system(s)
- Forensic workstation with analysis tools (Autopsy, Volatility, Timeline Explorer)
- Chain of custody documentation initiated for evidence handling
- Write-blocker for disk forensics or memory acquisition tool (e.g., DumpIt, WinPmem)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Locating and Understanding Prefetch Files

Prefetch files are typically located at `C:\Windows\Prefetch`. 
They are named ending with `.pf` (e.g., `CMD.EXE-4A81B364.pf`).

*Note: Prefetch is enabled by default on Windows Client OS architectures but may be disabled on Windows Servers.*

### Phase 2: Offline Analysis with PECmd (Eric Zimmerman's Tools)

```cmd
# Concept: Parse a single prefetch file PECmd.exe -f "C:\Windows\Prefetch\MIMIKATZ.EXE-53D22409.pf"

# PECmd.exe -d "C:\Windows\Prefetch\" -q --csv "C:\Forensics\Output" --csvf "prefetch_timeline.csv"
```

### Phase 3: Interpreting the Output

When examining the parsed output, focus on:
- **Run Count**: How many times was the binary executed?
- **Execution Times**: Up to 8 previous execution timestamps (depending on OS version). Last execution time is crucial for timeline building.
- **Files/Directories Accessed**: The directories and files the program loaded (e.g., DLLs, configuration files, text files the attacker interacted with).

### Phase 4: Basic Live System Check (Powershell)

```powershell
# Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Windows\Prefetch" | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "MIMIKATZ|PSEXEC|NC.EXE" } | Select-Object Name, LastWriteTime
```

#### Decision Point 🔀
