# Sysmon Process Creation Analysis (Event ID 1)

## When to Use
- During proactive threat hunting or reactive incident response to trace the execution flow of malware, scripts, or attacker activity.
- To detect the use of LOLBins (like PowerShell, cmd, certutil) and identify obfuscated command-line arguments indicating malicious intent.


## Prerequisites
- Forensic image or live access to the affected system(s)
- Forensic workstation with analysis tools (Autopsy, Volatility, Timeline Explorer)
- Chain of custody documentation initiated for evidence handling
- Write-blocker for disk forensics or memory acquisition tool (e.g., DumpIt, WinPmem)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding Event ID 1 Fields

```text
# Concept: Sysmon Event ID 1 ```

### Phase 2: Hunting for Suspicious Parent-Child Relationships

```powershell
# Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" | Where-Object { 
  $_.Id -eq 1 -and $_.Message -match "ParentImage:.*winword.exe" -and $_.Message -match "Image:.*(?:powershell\.exe|cmd\.exe|wscript\.exe|cscript\.exe)" 
} | Select-Object TimeCreated, Message | Format-List
```

### Phase 3: Detecting Command-Line Obfuscation and Encoding

```splunk
# index=sysmon EventCode=1 (CommandLine="*-e*" OR CommandLine="*-enc*" OR CommandLine="*-EncodedCommand*") Image="*\\powershell.exe"
| table _time, User, ParentImage, Image, CommandLine
```

### Phase 4: Hunting for Known LOLBins (Living Off The Land)

```spl
# index=sysmon EventCode=1 (Image="*\\certutil.exe" AND (CommandLine="*-urlcache*" OR CommandLine="*-f*" OR CommandLine="*-split*"))
| stats count by CommandLine, User, Computer
```
